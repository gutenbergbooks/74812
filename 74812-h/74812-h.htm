<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> story, devoid of literary pretensions, is
a simple narration of day by day experiences,
as they came to me, during five years of volunteer
work in hospitals of the Civil War.</p>

<p>At the risk of some slight repetition, it has been
thought best to include “Recollections of Lincoln”
and “Love in Camp” practically as they were
when published separately.</p>

<p>I wish to express my high appreciation and
thanks for the confidence and encouragement of
those friends who thought the book should be written
that the younger generations may know something
of the work done by women during the war.</p>

<p>To the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. M. Brundage, of Brooklyn, I am
especially indebted for practical suggestions that
have made the publication possible.</p>

<p>With some limitations, during two summers, I
betook myself to the unique Seventh-day-Baptist
University town of Alfred, New York, where the
story was written on the picturesque campus, in a
pure atmosphere free from all disturbing elements.</p>

<p>It has been a labor of love and pleasure to review
the old scenes, replete though they were with suffering
and death, for the thought of the comfort we
were able to give to the “Boys” and the remembrance
of their gratitude remain. In no other
benevolent work of my life was the reward so immediate
and so inspiring as in this ministration. I
have given real names and literal words as nearly
as possible, except in cases where there was something
unpleasant to relate; and I may truly add
that, even to be young again, I would not have
missed those years of incessant care and anxiety,
given in the hope of saving brave soldiers for their
country and their homes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> is not my intention to write history, but it
seems advisable to mention in a few brief notes
or extracts, for the benefit of the present generation,
the sentiments held during the Civil War.</p>

<p>When the first Confederate shot was fired upon
the United States flag, then floating over Fort
Sumter in Charleston Harbor, many months of unrest,
foreboding, and apprehension of a coming
terror were experienced by the people of the North.
This fatal shot caused the separation of hitherto
devoted families; fathers and sons were arrayed
against each other, some in hate, some in sorrow;
and even mothers, wives and sisters shared this unholy
animosity. All took pronounced sides with
North or South, except the “copperheads,” whom
all loyal Northerners despised.</p>

<p>General Winfield Scott, the hero of many a hard
fought Mexican battle, though quite superannuated,
was still in command of the United States
armies. Imperative, supercilious, an austere disciplinarian,
usually adorned with all the ornamentation
of his rank, with chapeau and white plumes, he
was, especially when well mounted, a conspicuous
figure, quite justifying his sobriquet of “Fuss and
Feathers.”</p>

<p>In consequence of the secession of South Carolina,
on December 20th, 1860, General Anderson,
commander of the forts of the harbor of Charleston
Bay, evacuated Fort Moultrie six days later.</p>

<p>The “Star of the West,” bringing reinforcements,
was fired upon by the Confederates, thus
preventing the landing of United States troops.</p>

<p>On April 11th, 1861, General Anderson refused
an order to surrender to General Beauregard, who,
during the 12th and 13th, ordered a furious bombardment
from the surrounding forts upon Fort
Sumter. Being unprepared for the attack, General
Anderson was compelled to capitulate and to take
refuge, with his garrison, on ships outside the harbor.
On April 14th, 1861, however, he saved the
National flag, which is now carefully preserved in
the Museum of the War Department at Washington,
no casualties having occurred.</p>

<p>The fort was held by the Confederates till the
evacuation of Charleston, February 17th, 1865.</p>

<p>On April 14th, 1865, General Anderson had the
happiness to raise the old flag once more, with his
own hands, over the demolished fort.</p>

<p>The following extracts from an unpublished letter
of John White Chadwick were selected and
kindly given me by Mrs. Chadwick.</p>

<p>“Land, ho!”</p>

<p>When at last it was permitted us to raise this cry,
we were indeed a happy company. We entered into
the experience of Columbus and Cabot and Balboa.
The pilot came on board. He told us, as the pilots
always did, to come to anchor, and we obeyed him.
And lying there on the still water, in the perfect air,
there came another feeling than that of joy. The atmosphere
grew heavy with deep thoughts and wonderful
associations. Our hearts were softened and our
eyes were dashed with sudden tears. In dark and lurid
splendor, all the great events of four long, painful years
rose up before us. And then again we hoisted anchor
and steamed slowly up toward the city in the deepening
twilight...................</p>

<p>The war ships, lying there like terrible grim monsters,
manned their rigging as we passed, and cheered
us lustily. But there was something in our throats
forbidding us to answer them with equal heartiness.</p>

<p>Passing under the battered walls of Sumter, we sang
with trembling voices, “Praise God from whom all
blessings flow.” And to the left was Wagner and the
ditch where Colonel Shaw was buried with his dark
but trusty men.</p>

<p>It happened so, that God in His great mercy, permitted
us to be bearers of great tidings to the city—&#8203;news
of the rebellion’s virtual end to this community
which saw its mad beginning. Once shouted from our
deck, it flew from wharf to wharf, from ship to ship,
and was received with shouts of thankful joy. The
night shut in over the accursed city as a band upon the
wharf played the dear strain “America.” It was a
time never to be forgotten, pregnant with thoughts
that must remain unspoken. Before I tried to sleep I
stepped ashore, and, just for a moment, standing there
under the silent stars, thanked God that He had
punished awful sin with awful retribution............</p>

<p>On Friday, just after ten o’clock, we started for the
fort in the steamer “Golden Gate,” which the Government
officials kindly placed at our disposal. About the
fort the scene was at once beautiful and exciting.
There were thirty ships and steamers in its immediate
vicinity, and they blossomed all over with flags. And
the little boats belonging to the war ships were shooting
here and there and everywhere, obedient to the
lusty strokes of their stout oarsmen, dressed for the
occasion in their very best.</p>

<p>We were on shore by half past twelve o’clock, and
wandering at will about the tattered mound that had
once been Fort Sumter. Indeed they had made “Ossa
like a wart.” It had no form or comeliness. It was
a perfect heap.......... Anon came General Anderson
and Mr. Beecher and the rest. The General’s speech
was, for so great an hour, the very smallest possible
affair. But when it came to raising the old flag he
did hoist away like a good fellow, and it went up right
handsomely. The people rose up as one man, and
shouted their hurrahs as if they thought to wake the
echoes from the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence to the Gulf. And the
band played “The Star Spangled Banner” just as if
they meant it,—&#8203;as they did of course. And then from
ship and fort the cannon thundered away like mad..........
And when they ceased with their roar Mr.
Beecher took it up and thundered, to good purpose,
for an hour or more..........</p>

<p>Saturday saw William Lloyd Garrison preside over
an assembly of two thousand colored people, if not
more, in Zion Church, and noble words were spoken
which these people did not fail to understand.........</p>

<p>From Charleston wharf to Hampton Roads our voyage
was pleasant, and the weather very fine...........
Going into Hampton Roads, on Tuesday, swiftly and
silently over the still water, we saw a vessel with her
colors at half mast. Not long after a pilot shouted to
us across the waves, from a great distance, that the
President was dead. Either we could not or we would
not believe it.</p>

<p>Another vessel sailed along with drooping colors and
told us <em>how he died</em>. And then the shadow of his death
swept down and folded from our sight all of those
great and rare experiences which we had been enjoying.
It seemed to us that we should never be able to
recollect them from that shadow. We went ashore at
the great fortress, where his dear feet had been,
scarcely a week before, but we had no eyes to see anything.............</p>

<p>It had been proposed to go to Portsmouth, Norfolk
and to City Point. But we had no heart for it. And
so we came together in the cabin and voted that we
would go home.</p>

<p class="p2">The Government called for seventy-five thousand
troops on April 15th to put down the rebellion “in
ninety days,” according to Secretary Seward’s confident
announcement.</p>

<p>On April 19th, the Sixth Regiment of the Massachusetts
Brigade, first to respond to the call, was
fired upon by a mob while passing through Baltimore,
and a number were wounded and some killed.</p>

<p>The Ellsworth Zouaves were enlisted chiefly
through the enthusiastic patriotism of young
Colonel Ellsworth, who, on arriving at Alexandria
with his regiment, saw a Confederate flag flying
above a small hotel, and at once ordered the flag
hauled down. This was refused, and the indignant
boy rashly rushed to the roof, and dared to pull it
down himself, when he was shot dead by the rebel
owner. Colonel Ellsworth was killed May 24th,
1861. Lincoln’s grief at the death of this daring
boy was overwhelming. Ellsworth had studied
law with him for a time in his office, and he loved
him as a son; and as a son and early martyr of the
war, he was laid in state at the White House for
funeral services.</p>

<p>War with its untold horrors had begun.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was becoming evident that President
Buchanan had permitted, or had at least become
strangely blind to the introduction of foreign
ammunition into Southern ports, while the traitor
Secretary Floyd, still under oath to the Union, held
his office until the last possible moment, encouraging
and assisting the South in building forts and, in
many ways, accumulating almost openly materials
of war.</p>

<p>At last the people awoke to the fact that many
southern regiments and garrisons were well
equipped for the conflict, while the unsuspecting
North was almost wholly unprepared. People had
become so accustomed to “fire-eaters’ bluster”
and their threats and boastings of the superior
prowess of the South that, if they listened at all, it
was considered mere political bombast which
passed unheeded until war was actually begun.</p>

<p>In November, 1861, General McClellan superceded
General Scott, who then retired from active
duty, at the age of seventy-five, and died later at
the good old age of eighty.</p>

<p>General McClellan began a slow thorough system
of discipline, which was very trying to the enthusiasm
of volunteer recruits, who soon discovered
that to use the pick and shovel were as essential
duties as carrying a musket, and were now compelled
to work in swamps and trenches throwing
up earthworks and entrenchments for many long
months.</p>

<p>The impatient public claimed that egotism and
ambition prevented General McClellan from moving
“on to Richmond,” thus prolonging the war,
and his army settled down before the enemy “in
masterly inactivity.” During this time many disgruntled
soldiers climbed hills and trees and saw
the city of Richmond practically defenseless “for
three days.” Still he did not move. This large
army had lived and worked in earthworks for many
weary months, until malaria and dysentery had sent
hundreds of incapacitated soldiers North to be
cared for. They were among the first bitter fruits
of the terrible struggle scarcely yet begun.</p>

<p>Not long after the defeat at Bull Run—&#8203;Manassas,—&#8203;both
sides claimed the victory,—&#8203;did
we for a moment believe that Southern courage
was equal to Northern valor in an open conflict, or
that the rebellion could not be put down within a
few months; and so we stood aghast when the attack
under General McDowell failed to put down
the rebellion in a single battle.</p>

<p>General Horatio C. King, in his address before
the thirty-seventh reunion of the Army of the Potomac,
repeated these potent words of General
Grant:</p>

<p>“As I recall the interview General Grant spoke
in substance as follows: ‘I cannot imagine why
any one should conceive for a moment that I would
not be glad to work in any capacity with General
McClellan. I have known him but little personally
since we served together in Mexico, but I have
always admired him both as a man and as a soldier,
and I am probably under greater obligations to
General McClellan than to any one man now living.
General McClellan was called to a great command,
unfortunately for him too early in the history of the
war, when many difficult military and political
questions remained unsettled. He and his acts
were the subject of wide discussion and unjust criticism,
but General McClellan was the man who
created the great instrumentality with which I had
the honor of closing out the rebellion. General
McClellan organized, trained, disciplined, led, and
inspired the Army of the Potomac. General McClellan
made that army the finest fighting machine
of our day, if not of any time. It was his good
work in creating that army which enabled me in
my turn to accomplish the things for which I received
the glory, and for all of which I am grateful
to General McClellan.’”</p>

<h3>LONG ISLAND COLLEGE HOSPITAL,
BROOKLYN</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> July, 1862, one hundred and twenty-five patients
from the Army of the Potomac were sent
to the Long Island College Hospital. No adequate
preparation had been made to provide for
these sick men. Through the press a public call
was sent out for volunteers. Many ladies and gentlemen
at once offered to help care for the sick,
and to supply food for their emaciated bodies.</p>

<p>An endorsement of the distinguished physician
of Romson Street, Dr. Burge, made me quite happy
by affording me the privilege of helping to care for
the soldiers in our city.</p>

<p>Among the large number of our best Brooklyn
people to volunteer their help and support was our
saintly Mrs. Richard Manning, who continued her
ministration throughout the long duration of the
war, and for many years after gave substantial help
to the destitute families of soldiers; and also Mrs.
Anna C. Field, chief organizer and president of the
Woman’s Club, as well as of the Woman’s Suffragist
Association. Both of these clubs celebrated,
during the spring of 1909, in the new Brooklyn
Academy of Music, the fortieth anniversary of their
organization. I believe that, in modern Brooklyn,
no other woman has done so much, in her long life
of benevolence and charity, as this Mother of
Brooklyn Clubs, for the elevation and encouragement
of women especially in ethics and literature.</p>
<p>Watches of four hours each during the day were
assigned to the women, and at night the same number
of hours were allotted to men volunteers.</p>

<p>Owing to the astonishing liberality of the citizens
of Brooklyn, the hospital donations seemed like a
great cornucopia overflowing the larders of the improvised
kitchen. Tender, motherly care, combined
with the best of diet, at once restored many a
poor, hungry homesick boy. Most of them recovered
and returned to their regiments or were sent
home.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_023.jpg"
 alt="Allan Foote">
 <p class="caption">ALLAN FOOTE</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>My first patient was a bright, cheerful young
man, Allan Foote, of Michigan, who had been dangerously
wounded by a shot that passed through
the left lung and out at his back. Such wounds
were then supposed to be fatal. He was, however,
convalescent, and later was discharged. When he
returned to his home in Michigan he again enlisted,
raised a company, and went out once more to the
front as captain. This time he served till the end
of the war, when he returned to his native State
safe and well.</p>

<p>A lady, wishing to say something flattering of
him to a visitor, remarked: “Why, he was shot
right in his back.” Seeing the boy wince at this
innocent imputation, I explained that he had received
that shot in the breast while facing the
enemy in battle.</p>

<p>Among many incidents of his early army life,
Allan Foote told me the following:</p>

<p>“I shall never forget his expression when my
father gave his written consent to my enlistment in
the army in April of ’61, as he handed it to me and
said, while tears were running down his cheeks,
‘My son, do your duty, die if it must be, but never
prove yourself a coward.’ We can hardly imagine
at what cost that was given, and it is now a source
of much satisfaction to me to know that God in His
mercy so guided me while in the service that no
action of mine has ever caused a pain to my father’s
heart, and when I returned at the close of the war
he seemed as proud of my scars as I was.”</p>

<p>John Sherman was a remarkable case of lost identity.
He was eighteen years of age, six feet in
height, with broad shoulders and a Washingtonian
head, and seemed like some great prone statue as
he lay perfectly helpless but for one hand,—&#8203;a gentle
fair-haired boy to whom we became much attached.
He was evidently refined, and perfectly clear on religious
and political subjects. Though without a
wound he had been completely paralyzed by concussion
caused by a cannon. He could take only
infants’ food and drank milk, which was all the
nourishment he could retain. The mystery was
that he claimed to come from Cattaraugus County,
N. Y., but when I wrote letters to every possible
locality, nothing could be learned of such a boy;
nor could the officers of his regiment trace him during
this time. Some scamp who claimed to come
from his town, was admitted through the carelessness
of the hospital attendants, and so deceived the
poor boy that he gave him ninety dollars army pay
just received, to send home to his father. Of course
the scamp was never heard of again. My theory is
that he enlisted under an assumed name and town,
and had, after the concussion, forgotten his real
name and identity. He was sent to the Fifty-second
Street hospital, where I saw him a year later,
walking alone and quite well,—&#8203;a finely developed
physical form. Though he knew me, he held to
his old statement. Later he was cruelly persuaded
to ask for a discharge which left him homeless, with
no refuge but the poor house.</p>

<p>Soldiers’ homes were then unknown; and I fear
that, at least for a while, he was cared for as a
pauper. About this time I went to the “field
work” and lost sight of him, though I have often
wondered what his fate has been.</p>

<p>A miserably thin, gaunt boy, whom we knew as
“Say,” came under my observation. He was
never satisfied, though he ate enormously, and
whenever we passed through his ward he invariably
shouted: “Say! ye ain’t got no pie nor cake, nor
cheese, nor nuthin’, hev ye?” When he reached
home, his father, a farmer, sent to the hospital the
largest cheese I ever saw. This the men all craved;
but it was a luxury denied them by the doctors.
Patients often had it smuggled in. One poor fellow
was found dead, one morning, with a package
of cheese under his pillow.</p>

<p>As the “L. I. C. H.” was a city hospital, emergency
and other cases were often brought in. A
pathetic case was that of a little boy about six years
old, who had been run over by a street car. As he
lay, pale and mangled, awaiting the time to have his
leg amputated, his mother, in broken English,
crooned and mourned over the unconscious child,
saying, “Ach, mine liddle poy, he will nefer run mit
odder poys in the street and haf not any more good
times.” I saw that the child would not live through
the operation, and tried to comfort the poor mother
while it was going on. When the mutilated, stark
little form was returned to her, her grief knew no
bounds, though she still believed he would revive.</p>

<p>In another ward poor Isaac was slowly dying of
dysentery, gasping for a drink of cool water, which
the rules of the profession at that day denied to
such patients. Day after day he lay helpless, while
a large water cooler dripped constantly day and
night before his feverish eyes and parched body.</p>

<p>One day he called to me and said: “Won’t you
please sit on my cot so I can rest my knees against
your back? They are so tired and I can’t hold
them up,”—&#8203;poor fleshless bones that had no
weight. Somewhat relieved while I sat there he
went on: “Now, Miss Smith, you think I am dying,
don’t you?”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_027.jpg"
 alt="Adelaide Smith">
 <p class="caption">ADELAIDE W. SMITH, 1863</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“Well, Isaac,” I replied hesitatingly, “we fear
you are.”</p>

<p>Then with all the strength of his poor skeleton
body, he exclaimed, “O then, give me a drink of
water that I may die easier. You know I am dying,
so it can do no harm.”</p>

<p>Could I refuse a dying man a drink of water,
even in the face of orders? He wanted “just a
pint.” Watching my chance I went quickly to the
cooler and brought a glass of cool water. With
unnatural strength he raised himself and, reaching
out for the glass, grasped it and swallowed
the water with one great gulp. Then returning
the empty glass he cried: “There, that was just
half! O, give me the other half.” This I did,
rather fearfully. After greedily drinking the water
he dropped back with a sigh of relief, saying—&#8203;“Now
I can die easy.” I arranged quietly with
my patients in the ward so that he could have water
as long as he lived; but not many days after I found
his empty cot.</p>

<p>The hospital, at that time, was little known, being
quite obscured under the limitations of two
conservative, retrogressive old doctors, who
showed no favor or sympathy for the sick men,
and seemed to see them only as probable “subjects.”</p>

<p>Many just protests from the kindly women workers
were utterly disregarded by these doctors. Dr.
Colton, a handsome young man then an interne,
though not of age or yet graduated, found himself
often between the “upper and nether millstones”
of the urgency of volunteer workers, and the immovable,
implacable heads of the hospital. Dr.
Colton, now a successful retired physician, occupies
a prominent position in this hospital which, in late
years, is ranked among the very best of Brooklyn’s
institutions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the people grew tired of the continual
demand for supplies, toward which the hospital
contributed very little, though it drew regularly
from the government “rations” in the form of
thirty-seven cents per day for each man. Consequently
public contributions became very meagre.</p>

<p>Then in the autumn came ninety-one sick and
wounded soldiers, who stood—&#8203;or dropped—&#8203;on
the grass plots surrounding the hospital while
waiting to be enrolled. A procession of grey skeletons,
they were ghastly, dirty, famished, with
scarcely the semblance of men. One of them
stared at me rather sharply and, seeing that I observed
it, said, “Excuse me, ma’am, I haven’t seen
a white woman before in many months, an’ it seems
good to look at you.”</p>

<p>It became difficult to get proper food in the hospital
for the men. Some of the volunteers, like
myself, could still give their whole time and thought
gratuitously, and we continued bringing supplies
from our homes for special cases. My mother sent
gallons of shell clam juice,—&#8203;the most healing of
all natural tonics when boiled in the shell,—&#8203;which
became popular in the hospital. My mother also
invited companies of four or five convalescents at a
time to “a good square meal,” when they always
chose for their suppers, coffee, buckwheat cakes
and sausages. Two gallons of batter would become
hot cakes; and it took the combined help of
the whole family and the cook to keep them supplied;
but the hungry boys were at last satisfied
and happy. I had no difficulty in obtaining passes
for them, as they felt in honor bound to return
promptly to the hospital.</p>

<p>One poor fellow, dying of typhoid, was so irritable
and profane to the ignorant, heartless men-nurses
of the hospital, that they would not care for
him during the night. Realizing that the end was
near, and feeling certain that he would otherwise
die alone, I decided one night to remain with him
until his last breath. Just before he died, even
while the pallor of death overspread his face, he
struck at the nurse whom I had compelled to stay
near to help him. At last the poor dying man
gasped: “Lift me up higher! higher! higher!!”
We raised the poor skeleton as high as we could
reach,—&#8203;and it was all over. His family refused
his body, saying, “He was no good to us in life,
why should we bury him?” It is not difficult to
imagine that his home influences had been unfavorable
to the development of moral character.</p>

<p>Clancy, then a fine looking, kindly policeman,
had waited to take me home near morning, as he
did on other occasions of this kind.</p>

<p>Some months later, being almost the only young
woman still visiting the hospital, I felt obliged to
report to that rarely good man, Mr. McMullen,—&#8203;whose
benevolence and generosity had at first
brought the patients to the hospital and to the care
of the people,—&#8203;the neglect of soldiers, who were
then treated like charity patients. He immediately
reported these conditions to the medical department,
and the men were removed to the government
hospitals, which were by this time systematized
and in good running order.</p>

<p>After the patients had been transferred from the
Long Island College Hospital, I secured a pass on
the steamboat Thomas P. Way, to visit hospitals
of the “Department of the East,” in charge of
Surgeon McDougall, a thorough disciplinarian,
and a just, kind man.</p>

<p>David’s Island, on the Sound, had a finely conducted
hospital, with a diet kitchen in charge of
ladies. There I saw hundreds of well-fed, happy
Confederate patients, so many, indeed, that they
could not be supplied at once with proper clothing,
and so made a unique appearance as they walked
about in dressing gowns, white drawers, and slippers.
They were soon to be exchanged for our
own poor skeleton “Boys” who were coming home
slowly and painfully, some dying on the way, to be
met by kindly hands and aching hearts eagerly
awaiting them.</p>

<p>Fort Schuyler Hospital, on the East River, was
formed like a wheel, the hub being headquarters
and the spokes extending into wards for patients.
One young man of much refinement had been at
one of our home suppers, and afterwards the company
made a pact that if we were alive one year
from that date we should hear each from the other.
He exclaimed—&#8203;“Dead or alive, you shall hear
from me!” Being a spiritualist he believed this
possible. He was sent to Fort Schuyler and one
month later died of small-pox. At the appointed
date and hour a year later, I thought of this pact
and tried to put myself in a receptive state. I did
not, however, see him nor feel any manifestation
of his spirit.</p>

<h3>BEDLOE’S ISLAND (NOW LIBERTY)</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A number</span> of influential ladies of New York
City had formed a society named “Park
Barracks Association.” By permission of the
Mayor, barracks were put up in the City Hall Park
for temporary accommodation of soldiers. But
of that particular work I knew very little. These
ladies had, however, extended their benevolence to
Bedloe’s Island. They had, somehow, heard of my
work, and a committee waited upon me with an invitation
to accompany them, by the Thomas P.
Way, on its regular trip to the department hospitals
on the river, including Bedloe’s Island, three and a
half miles down New York Bay, where they wished
me to take charge of their “diet kitchen.” Fort
Wood still stands on one side of the island, little
changed since 1862. At that time twenty wards
were filled with about eighty patients.</p>

<p>The first floor of the square brick building on the
New York side was used as a dispensary, and the
diet kitchen was also located here. On the second
floor were the quarters of sick officers, occupied at
that time by only one officer who had been wounded
at Antietam. Comfortable rooms on the third
floor became my apartments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_034.jpg"
 alt="Surgeon Campbell">
 <p class="caption">SURGEON CAMPBELL</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Each lady had a different opinion concerning the
management of the kitchen, and urged the wisdom
of her particular plan. I soon discovered, however,
that Surgeon Campbell, in charge of the hospital,
had been so annoyed by the irregular work of these
ladies, that he had threatened to close the kitchen.
Small wonder, when a different lady came each
week and spent most of her time in undoing the
work of her predecessor! They were extremely
anxious to have me take charge at once, but I
asked for twenty-four hours in which to consider,
though my mind was already made up. This being
a volunteer work, I wrote the next day, saying that
I would take charge of the kitchen on one condition—&#8203;namely,
that I should have no interference
or direction from any member of the Association.
This they thought rather severe, but it was my
ultimatum. They were glad to accept my terms,
however, in order that they might continue their
benevolent work on the island.</p>

<p>The day after I took charge, Surgeon Campbell
came into the kitchen for inspection and stood
aghast at the “confusion worse confounded.” I
was standing on a chair in a closet, throwing in
heaps on the floor endless packages from the
shelves. I laughed at his despairing expression,
and said, “Doctor, do not expect any order within
three days, till these incongruous piles are classified.”
There were shoes and cornstarch, “trigger”
finger gloves and dried apples, shirts and
beans, “feetings” and comfort bags, and so on ad
infinitum.</p>

<p>The clothing supplies I now separated from the
food donations, and had them sent up to my rooms,
where, later, the men came with their demands, or
with written orders from the ladies, one or more of
whom came every day. I soon discovered that,
owing to a lack of system, some of the men had
succeeded in getting four shirts instead of one; but
I concluded that they were four times colder than
their warmer-hearted comrades.</p>

<p>At last out of confusion came order. With the
help of Surgeon Campbell I planned a printed list,
lacking only the addition of the date, name of surgeon,
and number of ward to which were to be
added each day’s orders. I went over this at night,
frequently adding extras, and in the morning it was
sent to the different wards when the ward masters
came for breakfast. The doctors then selected the
proper diet for their patients, and the list was returned
before ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Four detailed soldiers acted as cooks and helpers.
Andrew, a practical, kindly Scotchman, became
head cook; and altogether we were much
gratified by our good fare. Our success along this
line was made easier by liberal government supplies,
and the generous donations of the Association,
which gave me “carte blanche” for special
cases. Our system worked admirably. When the
dinner bugle sounded, the ward masters ran with
their trays and pails; the first in order calling out
his ward number as he entered. I read aloud from
one of the twenty lists, which varied slightly each
day, and were kept hanging in a row. For example:</p>

<p class="p2">The cook served meats and vegetables, one
served tea, coffee or milk in pails, while I managed
the jellies, stimulants, etc. We soon reduced the
time of distribution for eighty patients to fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>When Surgeon McDougall, in charge of the department,
came with his staff to inspect our kitchen,
they waited till all was served to the ward masters,
and then he said: “Miss Smith, you have the best
conducted kitchen in the Department.” Having
had little experience in cooking, this was a very
pleasant surprise. The inspection was continued
by a member of the staff passing his white-gloved
hand over the range and sides of the iron kettles,
etc., which the men kept so clean that they left no
trace. The men were also made happy by the approval
of the inspectors.</p>

<p>In addition to this we made large puddings for
the twenty wards, ten each day being all that our
ovens could hold.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Surgeon Campbell, a courteous
Scotch gentleman and strict disciplinarian, I
wore a dress of officers’ blue with infantry buttons,
medical cadet shoulder straps with green bands
and gilt braid in the centre.</p>

<p>The Thomas P. Way came daily at 10 A. M.
bringing ladies of the Association and many other
visitors. Andrew had learned to make “perfect
cocoa,” which I had served to the guests in my
rooms, where, from the large windows, they enjoyed
the fine view of Long Island, New Jersey
and New York shores.</p>

<p>This was before the days of “Liberty Island,”
which later was made immortal by the gift of the
French people and the great sculptor Bartholdi,
whose heroic statue was to have been completed
for the great centennial fair of 1876. Failing to
accomplish this in time, he sent to Philadelphia the
arm holding the torch which now lights the bay,
and is a well known signal light to incoming vessels.
While in Philadelphia, attending the exposition,
with seven friends I climbed the narrow ladder
in the arm, and all were able to sit in the circle
of the great torch, now upheld by “Liberty.”</p>


<p class="p2 center">DAILY ROUTINE</p>

<p>Each morning I awoke at George’s call—&#8203;“Ha’f-a-pas-seex.”
Andrew would send up a good breakfast
for two, as there was always some lady friend
or one of my younger sisters to keep me company
at night. No other woman except the wives and
friends of the officers at the fort were allowed to
remain on the island. The cooks soon learned to
manage the men’s breakfast without me.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock A. M. a dozen or more men came
to my door with orders from the ladies for underwear
and many comforts. George, who did the
work of a chambermaid, having cleared up my reception
room (I did my own sleeping room) I then
descended into the kitchen and immersed myself in
the work of making jellies and other delicacies,
while I had four disabled soldiers preparing meats,
vegetables, etc.</p>

<p>At ten A. M. came the boat, bringing guests for
luncheon, when we had officers, sisters of charity,
clergymen, and friends of the patients to entertain,
all of whom needed advice or a pleasant word.
This caused many interruptions; but was a pleasant
break in the monotony of hospital life.</p>

<p>The visitors left on the four P. M. boat. I then
inspected the various wards and discovered many
delinquencies on the part of the men nurses of
which the patients were afraid to complain. Occasionally
there was time for a walk around the sea
wall, and then came the men’s supper at five P. M.</p>

<p>At six dinner was served in my reception room
for my friends and myself, and Andrew insisted
upon its being a good one. After that officers and
their ladies sometimes called.</p>

<p>When the wind howled and the waves dashed
high against the sea wall, we could see the twinkling
lights of the city while we sat talking and resting
till “taps.” Then came George to attend to
his wonderful coal fires in very large open grates,
which never burned low or dropped ashes on the
bright polished hearth. His greatest reward was
a pleasant word about the fires and he would smile
in happiness. Then he brought a bucket of salt
water fresh from the bay for my nightly bath, after
which we retired to our comfortable cots, where
we slept restfully till awakened by the usual “Ha’f-a-pas-seex.”</p>

<p>I remember an incident in which human perversity
strongly asserted itself. General Wool,
then Commander of the Department of the East,
sent an order that “No one be allowed to leave the
island till further orders.” It was suspected that
spies were stealing information from the forts. No
one was permitted to go even aboard the boat
which brought daily supplies.</p>

<p>At once we felt ourselves prisoners, and an irresistible
desire to escape to the city haunted me
every hour of the day. I was actually planning to
elude the guards and to be rowed in a little boat to
the city,—&#8203;three and one-half miles from the
island,—&#8203;when the order was revoked, and I suddenly
discovered that I had no urgent object for
making the trip.</p>

<p>The post chaplain drew very few to his services.
One patient remarked “We can sleep much better
in our cots than in the chapel.” One Sunday afternoon,
after considerable effort, I succeeded in
raising a quartette among the non-commissioned
officers. I then went to all the wards, urging the
men to come to our services, promising them some
good old-time hymns. The chaplain was much
surprised and gratified at this sudden increase in
his congregation, and this improvement was maintained
till most of the patients had left the island.</p>

<p>At last orders were read for all convalescents to
report to their regiments. This quite emptied the
wards and took my staff of domestic helpers. I
had a busy time supplying the Boys with necessary
articles and luxuries, and “comfort bags” containing
sewing material were in great demand! In
some of these were found letters that led to correspondence
and in many cases to romance.</p>

<p>As the “Way” left the wharf, these grateful
men expressed their thanks by rousing cheers to
the surgeons and nurses who had taken such good
care of them. Then came three more cheers for
the kind ladies who had given them so many luxuries
and comforting words. Being the only lady
present I waved a hearty good-bye for all these
kindly women.</p>

<p>My work there was practically over, as the few
patients who were left could be supplied from the
regular mess hall, so I returned to my home in
Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Some days later I crossed Fulton Ferry and, to
my surprise, found Broadway deserted. The draft
riot was spreading. From the 13th to the 16th of
July, 1863, the streets were practically given over
to a crowd of hoodlum boys brandishing clubs and
sticks, rushing wildly and howling “Niggers, niggers!
Hang the niggers!” They did hang some
to lamp posts. Negro shanties were fired and occupants
driven into the flames. A colored orphan
asylum was attacked and burned. One poor fellow
was chased for miles, and at last he jumped into a
pool of water, preferring to drown rather than to
be hanged or beaten to death. This riot, the most
disgraceful and cowardly of all horrible crimes that
ever disgraced modern New York City, resulted in
the death of nearly one thousand people, mostly
negroes, and was incited by two copperheads whose
names should be abhorred forever.</p>

<p>A handsome boy patient of about seventeen
years attached himself to me, much to my annoyance,
and I found it difficult to give him the attention
he desired. At last, however, to my great relief,
he was ordered to report to his regiment,
whence he wrote frequently. About six months
later, to my astonishment, he came to my home,
saying, “I was so homesick I just had to come,
and I ran away without asking for a furlough.”
Of course he was liable to arrest as a deserter, and
it cost me much persuasion and insistence at military
headquarters, to convince them that the boy
was ignorant of the treachery of his act. But
finally, after much advice, he started for his regiment
with a return pass. About a year later he
wrote asking my advice as to his marrying “a very
nice girl,” as he thought “an economical wife
could help him to save money,”—&#8203;on twelve dollars
a month, forsooth!

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">While</span> the devastations of Civil War were
sending thousands of our brave men to
die, and to sleep in distant graves, inadequate
relief for sick and wounded soldiers also
caused much unnecessary suffering and loss of life.
Lacking more prompt means of assistance, supplies,
surgeons, nurses, et cetera, could reach them only
through the slow process of military regulations.</p>

<p>With the hope of supplying this most urgent
need, the great Manhattan fair of the United States
Sanitary Commission was suggested, and later organized
by the efforts of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Doctor Bellows of
New York City. He became its president, and,
with other gentlemen as a committee, went to
Washington to consult military and hospital departments
as to some feasible manner of supplementing
this most necessary branch of the United
States service.
</p>

<p>The congregation of All Souls’ Church, of which
Dr. Bellows was pastor, at once voted that the
$40,000 that had been appropriated for a church
steeple should be donated to the great Fair. The
steepleless church stands to-day, a monument to
their practical benevolence.</p>

<p>Their beneficent intention resulted in the erection
of an immense wooden building at Union Square
and Fourteenth Street, New York City, for a great
bazaar. The opening took place on April 14th,
1864, the Honorable Joseph Choate delivering an
address. An original poem by Oliver Wendell
Holmes was sung by a union of many volunteer
church choirs, before a vast multitude. The verses
at the head of this chapter are selected from the
poem.</p>

<p>The building was practically overflowing with
the number of enormous donations that had no
precedent, nor has any later benevolence in our
country ever equalled this cheerful, spontaneous
outpouring of money and salable goods, from all
classes and individuals, merchants and dealers of
every grade. These gifts of every description
were piled high on shelves and in beautifully arranged
booths, where charming young girls and
earnest bright-eyed women competed in the selling
of them to hundreds of eager buyers. Wealthy,
generous patrons vied with one another in liberal
purchases and donations, while those of smaller
means were also happy in giving their mites to
swell the enormous sums that astonished even the
sanguine organizers. Many others, having no
means to spare, volunteered their entire time and
services to any department needing them, however
laborious or unpleasant. And here they worked
cheerfully every day until midnight during the
three weeks of the fair, unconscious of weariness.
Probably in no other bazaar were there ever such
tireless workers, generous donors, or enthusiastic
buyers. The united beneficence, patriotism and
good will of these people poured into the treasury
of the Sanitary Commission the enormous amount
of two million dollars. This great sum for those
days enabled the Commission to perfect an organization
unparalleled in scope and efficiency, with a
corps of faithful, honorable workers.</p>

<p>Like the Red Cross, which came to us later from
Switzerland, this commission was immune from
attack after battles. Often following the army
closely, its representatives were able to set up
temporary hospitals more quickly and efficiently
with their independent supplies, army wagons and
even transportation for special duty, than could be
done by the regular army routine. Later my opportunity
for knowing their work for soldiers was
unusual. Being the only person in the hospital
camp in the field working independently, without
pay for any service, and provided with a pass from
United States Army’s Headquarters, the commission
claimed that I was entitled to my living and
any supplies I might require for the sick.</p>

<p>The relation here of an instance of personal experience
will give some idea of the capability and
prompt action of the commission immediately after
the close of the war, and at almost the last moment
of its field work, at City Point, Virginia.</p>

<p>The armies of the James and Potomac were
ordered to Washington as speedily as transportation
would permit. They were to take part in the
grand review and were to be mustered out of
service. The sick were also carried to Washington
hospitals as soon as they were able to sail on
the transports now crowding the docks of City
Point. The headquarters of the United States
Armies in the field had some time previously been
transferred to Washington, where, still later, I
often saw General Grant, always silent and smoking,
except when in the presence of ladies.</p>

<p>General Russell, with his colored troops, was
left in command at City Point to finish up the
Government work there. Surgeon Thomas Pooley,
later a distinguished oculist, of New York City,
had been left in charge of the almost abandoned
field hospital. Barracks and tents were dismantled,
canvas roofs were removed and “turned
in” to the Government, leaving only stockade
walls, much useless camp furniture, and debris of
all sorts that it would have been unprofitable to
ship north.</p>

<p>Into these roofless wards swarmed crowds of
destitute “contrabands” from the surrounding
country and from Petersburg, eight miles distant,
and settled down like flocks of crows. They found
many things that were treasures to them among
the abandoned supplies and rations upon which
they subsisted until the government could devise
some plan to save these helpless wandering
creatures from starvation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figcenter-->
 
<p>The word contraband as applied to negroes was
first used May <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr>, 1861, by General Ben Butler,
soon after taking command of Fortress Monroe,
when three slaves escaped from work on a Confederate
fort, near by, and came across the river in a
boat asking protection. The owner sent for them
by flag of truce. General Butler decided that tho
not strictly legal that as a war measure he was
justified as they were property to their owners and
that with all other property used against the Union
they were “contraband of war,” and refused to
give them up. The number of runaway slaves to
the fort “increased to $60,000 worth of negroes,”
who were put to work for the Union army,—&#8203;many
of whom enlisted and served faithfully till
the end of the war.</p>

<p>At that time I was the only white woman in
camp, waiting for orders to report to the New
York State agency in Washington. A kind
motherly old colored “auntie” seemed to consider
me merely a child, and constantly followed me
about, watched over me, and became my general
guardian. General Russell kept a guard of four
colored soldiers, with stacked arms, night and day,
about my quarters for my safety.</p>

<p>I was about to start for Washington when we
were surprised by a belated regiment,—&#8203;of the
6th corps, I think,—&#8203;of sick men toiling wearily
into the deserted hospital camp, now in confusion
as if a raid had torn everything asunder. There
was not a furnished bed or bunk for these poor
sick discouraged men to lie upon, nor was there
any food for their famished bodies as they dropped
upon the bare ground exhausted, almost fainting.</p>

<p>I still had the use of an ambulance, and in this
emergency hastily ordered the driver to take me
to City Point, one-half mile distant, for help.
Fortunately the Sanitary Commission barge,
loaded with surplus supplies, had not started, but
was just about to cut loose, when I informed them
of the destitution and helplessness of the sick
stranded soldiers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_050.jpg"
 alt="J. YATES PEEK">
 <p class="caption">J. YATES PEEK</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->
 
<p>Mr. J. Yates Peek, formerly of the 147th New
York Infantry, at once reversed orders, unpacked
supplies, and put his men to work. By night the
barracks were covered with canvas roofs; comfortable
beds were made of fresh hay, and the men
were fed. The “contrabands” cheerfully assisted me
in preparing food and caring for the
famished men. I think Doctor Pooley was the
only surgeon in camp. Contrabands helped, in
their rude way, to nurse the helpless, and a little
camp sprang up and remained until the men were
able to travel and get transportation to Washington.
There was probably no better work done by
this great organization than that by the belated
company of agents of the United States Commission
in that emergency. Without their help and
supplies these men must have suffered keenly, and
perhaps have died before relief could have been
sent back from Washington on an unprecedented
requisition, and the necessary “red tape” regulations
complied with.</p>

<p>Another personal experience comes to mind.
Months after the war, at their New York City
Headquarters, when all liabilities of the Sanitary
Commission had been met and field work disbanded,
there was still a considerable balance in
the treasury. The money had been collected for
a specific purpose, namely—&#8203;for the benefit of
sick soldiers. This need was now supplied by the
Government in various hospitals and in temporary
homes, but the surplus money could not legally or
honorably be applied to any other benevolence.
Finally it was agreed that soldiers’ families were
the legitimate heirs to this soldiers’ fund. Therefore
Mrs. Baldwin, a woman of great tact and
capability, with myself, was asked to visit their
families and judiciously assist the needy. Through
that unusual bitterly cold winter of ’65 and ’66 we
visited and assisted many of them. With the advent
of warm weather the last dollar was expended,
and the official life of this great beneficent work
ended. Through it thousands of lives were saved,
and many cheered and made comfortable.</p>

<p>At the Brooklyn Sanitary Fair over $400,000
were raised, and in Chicago and the West, that had
led in this great movement, chiefly through the
efforts of women, the amounts were astonishing.
Through the great heart of the people, from all
sources over $25,000,000 came into the treasury
of the Sanitary Commission.

<h3>NEW ENGLAND ROOMS</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Colonel Frank Howe</span>, of the New
England Rooms, on Broadway near Fulton
Street, New York City, was the director of
that Rest for stranded and sick soldiers, as well as
for many helplessly wounded. Here I found many
of the most interesting cases of my experience.
Colonel Howe felt that their contribution of
wounded to the Sanitary Fair would be a more
effective object-lesson and incentive, than inanimate
war emblems and relics displayed in the
Arms and Trophy Department. Some of these
crippled men were now waiting for Government
to provide homes for those incapable of self-support.</p>

<p>Colonel Howe thereupon secured free passes for
a number of convalescents, and I consented to take
charge of them during the fair. Consequently,
one bright day, the New England ambulance was
crowded with the following passengers, namely:
one man without legs, two men without arms, one
blind from a shot passing through his head, a one-legged
boy, the famous John Burns of Gettysburg,
and a colored woman to assist. I sat on the
front seat with the driver. We drove up Broadway
to the fair grounds, quite regardless of the
curious crowd that followed.
</p>

<p>These brave martyrs were received with outstretched
hands and cordial sympathy, and given
the freedom of every department in the wonderful
exhibition. In a splendid restaurant I volunteered
to act as waiter, that I might be certain that the
Boys had good meals and attention, for which the
Sanitary Commission made no charge.</p>

<p>A crowd followed armless Berry who carried on
his strong back legless Smith,—&#8203;who in turn
dressed and fed Berry. These two had become
great friends and, like the Siamese twins, were inseparable.
Always cheerful, they seemed to enjoy
life. Smith was a good penman and wrote me interesting
letters, of which I still have some, generally
signed “Berry and Smith.” Berry often
carried the legless man about the large building to
see the wonders which they greatly enjoyed.</p>

<p>Another armless soldier, a sergeant always in
uniform, travelled about alone, and when in cars or
boats was rarely asked for fare, or if so, he would
say: “Help yourself from my pockets.” Few had
the heart to do this, so he usually travelled free.</p>

<p>McNulty, a refined young man, who had lost an
arm in an early engagement, but was now quite
well, was also of our party, though he was quite
independent and asked no help, having already
learned, like General Howard, to use his left arm
for writing and to serve double duty.</p>

<p>Famous John Burns was included with those
mentioned above in the freedom of the whole
building, and at seventy years of age called himself
one of my “Boys.” The following is copied from
a card which he had printed to “save so much
talk,” and which he claimed was a true history of
his experience and help in the renowned battle of
Gettysburg. This card he gave me personally.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">JOHN L. BURNS’ ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I was born in Burlington, New Jersey, on the
5th day of September, 1793. I served in the war
of 1812. At the outbreak of the Rebellion, I went
with Captain McPherson to Camp Wayne, Westchester,
where I enlisted, but was discharged at the
end of a fortnight on account of my age. I returned
to Gettysburg (my home at that time),
then went to Hagerstown and served as assistant
in the wagon camp for two weeks, after which, as
a teamster, I joined the three months’ boys under
Patterson, with whom I remained a month. I
then went to Frederick, and obtained the position
of police officer in General Banks’ division. I was
present at the battle of Edward’s Ferry, and saw
Colonel Baker carried across the river. I remained
with Colonel Banks for six months, and then returned
home, where I was at the time of the battle
of Gettysburg. On the first day of the fight I
met General Reynolds, who had been out reconnoitering,
and was asked to show him the Emmettsburg
road. After doing this, I obtained a
musket from a soldier who had been wounded
while on guard, and went off to the army ‘to shoot
some of the damned rebels’. I fell in with a Wisconsin
regiment, and fought sometimes in line, and
sometimes on my own hook. About one P. M.,
during an intermission, while lying in the woods,
I saw a Missouri man fall from the shot of a rebel
concealed in the bushes. I stepped behind a tree,
and seeing the rebel about to reload, I shot him.
I also shot a tremendous great rebel who would
not get out of my way. I myself received seven
balls on the first day of the fight, the last of which
wounded me severely in the leg. I lay on the
field all night, and a rebel surgeon gave me water
and a blanket. In the morning I crawled to a
house near by, and about two P. M. succeeded in
being taken to my own house, which I found
occupied by the rebels as a hospital. Their doctor
dressed my wound. On Friday, at two P. M. I
was closely questioned by two rebel officers as to
where I got my musket.”</p>

proudly the shabby old coat with bullet holes in
the front corners. This is not given in the life size

<h3>ARMS AND TROPHY DEPARTMENT OF THE
SANITARY COMMISSION FAIR</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> department was beautifully draped with
bunting, Revolutionary, Mexican and other
old war flags, and also a few Confederate
flags, captured by regiments, still in the field, that
had yet many a bloody battle to fight. A number
of distinguished, elegantly-gowned women toiled
here indefatigably, brimming over with excitement
and patriotism, quite regardless of the unusual
fatigue of standing and working so many hours
daily, in their anxiety to allow no one to pass
without contributing in some way to the fund, now
reaching thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Here was to be decided the “sword test,” that
would indicate the most popular general, by the
number of votes cast at one dollar each. The
sword was to be presented to the winner of the
largest number of votes. How these attractive
ladies worked for their favorites! A magnetic
thrill pervaded this room, where men of fashion
and reputation crowded, ostensibly to learn how
the vote was going.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant, a noble-looking woman, accepted
graciously, but without solicitation, all who offered
votes for General Grant, of whom she invariably
spoke as “Mr. Grant.” Mrs. McClellan, with
elegant society manner, lost no opportunity in
gaining a vote for General McClellan; her vivacity,
personal charm, and courteous flattery won many
a vote for her husband. I think if her son, our
ex-mayor, could have seen his mother at the height
of her matured beauty he would have been justly
proud.</p>

<p>The polls were to close at midnight on the last
day of the fair. Excitement ran high as the hour
approached. At ten minutes before the hour the
McClellan vote was far ahead, and that party was
already exulting, confident of success; but at five
minutes before the final closing of the polls, the
Union League, of Philadelphia, telegraphed,
ordering “five hundred votes for Grant,” and the
sword was his.</p>

<p>Indignant Democrats pronounced this an act of
treachery; an ominous dissent spread over the
restless crowd, and for a time it seemed as if there
might be some dangerous demonstration. Only
the general refinement and restraint of the surging,
self-respecting crowd prevented an outbreak.</p>

<p>Mrs. McClellan was pitifully disappointed, as her
vision of the White House grew dim; and after the
popular election of Grant, and the defeat of McClellan,
she indignantly declared that she would not
live in such an ungrateful country. She actually
lived abroad for some years but, like all good
Americans, she was happy to return to enjoy the
freedom of her own native land.</p>

<p>In the month of February, 1909, I had the pleasure
of seeing again, in the Smithsonian Museum at
Washington, the veritable sword of that memorable
contest, which had been presented in April,
1863. Other swords and equipments of General
Grant were preserved in a large glass case. A
silver head of Liberty formed the handle, set with
diamonds, garnets and turquoises, the hilt and
shield in bas-relief of a helmeted knight, the blade
and scabbard highly wrought in oxidized silver and
gold. The Chattanooga is the largest and finest
of six or eight swords, all highly wrought and
jewelled, which were presented by admiring friends
at different dates to General Grant.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Fair I had obtained permission
for the three men, Smith, Berry and
Mudge, to remain in the trophy department, where,
each day, many greenbacks were crowded into
their pockets. I had asked Mesdames Grant and
McClellan to head subscription lists and to solicit
money for the three helpless soldiers. Both ladies
cheerfully and effectively urged people to subscribe
at one dollar each, and at the close of the
last evening they were happy to hand over to me,
to be divided among these living martyrs of our
cruel war, the sum of about five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>A citizen, employed by the New England
Rooms, had charge of the finances and of the safe.
He came every night with the ambulance to take
me and the mutilated men back to the New England
Rooms to sleep. On this last night I handed
him the great roll of five hundred one-dollar bills
to carry home and put into the safe. Instantly,
however, an impulse came to me, and I said: “Just
let me look at that money to see if it is all right.”
Grasping it firmly, I did not return it to the man,
but carried it safely to the Rest, and kept it during
the night. Before morning the scamp had robbed
the safe and vanished, and of course was never
more heard of. Was it telepathy or a finer psychic
perception that saved the boys their money?</p>

<p>A unique incident occurred at this Rest, to the
great amusement of the Boys. I frequently stayed
here all night with the capable matron, Mrs. Russell,
in her apartments on the top floor of this
former store-house. One evening we were startled
by unusual hilarity among the patients on the floor
below. A great “well” was open through the
middle of the building for the purpose of raising
merchandise to the upper floors, and now it served
as a fine ventilator. On stepping forward to the
railing we saw to our astonishment three boys,
each having lost a leg. They were great chums,
always together, and sometimes the group was
called “Three Legs.” Each was on a crutch,
carrying in one hand an artificial government leg,
and they were having a grotesque dance with these
limbs and crutches. To the men it seemed very
funny and caused roars of laughter, but I failed to
find amusement in the gruesome antics of these
boys, scarcely of age, crippled for life.</p>

<p>Colonel Mrs. Daily, whom I met at the New
England Rooms, enjoyed the unique honor of
having been appointed adjutant on the staff of
Governor Sprague, of Rhode Island. Colonel
Daily had just returned from a tour of inspection
of Rhode Island regiments stationed near the front
and had also visited sick soldiers in different hospitals.
She had prepared and published a general
and statistical report of the condition of the men to
present officially to Governor Sprague.</p>

<p>After my success in collecting funds for Mudge,
Smith and Berry at the Sanitary Fair, I concluded
to take them to the great exposition then
being held at Philadelphia, but for some unexplained
reason my efforts to secure financial aid for
them met with comparative failure.</p>

<p>A handsome ambulance of the Wicacoe fire
engine company had met us at Camden boat landing,
Philadelphia, whence we were driven to the
famous Union Volunteer Refreshment Saloon and
Hospital, where a few cots for special cases had
been set up in the private offices. Here these
three men were warmly welcomed and made comfortable
during their visit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lincoln called there one day, and, after a
pleasant talk, gave twenty dollars to each of the
“Twins.” They seemed to appreciate her kindly
words even more than her practical gift.</p>

<p>When troops were approaching the city of Philadelphia,
the great “Liberty Bell” rang out a welcome
to coming regiments. Hundreds of kindly
women, laden with good things, hastened to this
large building, which was a cooper’s shop, quickly
set up rough tables, and spread their generous supplies
ready for the hungry men. During the war
thousands of men and many regiments halted here
for “a good square meal,” while passing through
the city to the front. When the hungry Boys were
rested and satisfied, they fell into line and marched
away to the music of the jolly fife and drum,
cheering and shouting their thanks, only exceeded
in sound by the deafening applause of the
patriotic people waiting to see them off. This
“shop,” by the generosity of its owners, and the
unflagging patriotism of the women, became
historical. Many full regiments remembered the
good things freely given by those who had not
always an abundant living for themselves.</p>

<p>The following is a verbatim copy of a letter
written by one of the “Twins” from the Union
Volunteer Refreshment Saloon and Hospital, generally
known as the Cooper Rest Hall, referred to
above:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
“Philadelphia, June <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr>, 1864.<br>
</p>

<p>Miss Adelaide Smith:</p>

<p class="unindent">Dear Madam:—</p>

<p>I have just received your kind and welcome letter
and now hasten to reply. I am glad to hear of your
safe arrival in New York, and regret that friend Mudge
cannot exercise sufficient control over himself to prevent
so much useless trouble to his friends but I anticipated
as much. I hope the air of the Astor House
will be congenial to him. Berry has been seeking the
paper you refer to but has not yet gotten it. He will
go out to-day and get it, if he can, and send it to you.</p>

<p>Shortly after Berry went out with you, the day you
left, Mrs. Lincoln visited the Saloon and had a little
talk with me (Smith) and a $20.00 bill was slipped into
my hand. I believe there is $20.00 expected for Berry
from the same source.</p>

<p>With regard to pecuniary matters Philadelphia is
looking up. In addition to the above donation I have
received $25.00, and Berry about $20.00. Berry is out
occasionally, hence the difference between us, but
Berry will stay in the Saloon alongside of me and no
doubt we will both share alike.</p>

<p>Berry was walking along Chestnut Street on Monday
when a man standing at a doorway stopped him,
questioned him, did he know Miss Furness? Yes.
Well Miss Furness has been everywhere trying to find
us, wishing very much to see us. Miss Furness was
then in the house. Berry was invited in to see her.
She commenced the old story about the artificial arms
and legs. We expect she will go to the fair and peddle
out the rest of her old jewelry which will, she expects,
enable her to give us some fifteen or twenty
thousand dollars each. In fact our expectations are
raised to such a pitch and we are so sanguine of Miss
Furness that we shall probably have a surplus of a few
thousand, dear Madam for you, as a ‘slight testimonial
of our esteem and mark of our gratitude’; etc., etc.
She has also a box full of artificial arms and legs.</p>

<p>Will you please tell Price to forward all letters
there may be in the hospital for Berry and me. Mr.
Redner has not yet called.</p>

<p>I hope Mr. D. will get my furlough extended, at
any rate I shall stay here some time longer. We are
getting along very comfortably. There is nothing
particular in the way of news. Berry and I went out
sailing a day or two ago.</p>

<p>All the good folks here beg to be remembered to
you, Mr. Wade in particular. Our best regards to all
our friends, Mr. D. especially, and believe us, dear
Madam,</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Yours very gratefully,</span><br>
ALBERT A. SMITH and JOHN H. BERRY.<br>
</p>

<p>P. S. If you have time, in case you pass through
Philadelphia, to call and see us, it will afford us much
pleasure.”</p>
</div>

<p>On our return to New York, as in going to
Philadelphia, every one wished to lend a helping
hand, but Smith clung to Berry, who carried him
with ease, while the crowd cheered the courageous,
independent fellows. On returning them safely to
the New England Rooms, I longed to rest for a
few days at my home in Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn,
but I found at the Rooms a slowly dying
woman who greatly excited my sympathy. She
had been brought from Washington, where she had
contracted dysentery while nursing her son, who
died soon after she reached him. She was on her
way to her home in Worcester, Massachusetts.
There was no proper place for the poor soul, and
Colonel Howe was anxious to have her reach her
home before she died, so I took charge of her, and
we went by the Fall River Line. I sat beside her
stretcher all night in the ladies’ cabin, watching her
pulse and constantly giving her stimulants or nourishment.
At daybreak we reached Worcester.
The man sent to assist me found an express wagon
on which the stretcher was placed, and we all drove
to a plain comfortable-looking house. Finding no
responsible person about the place I took possession
of the parlor on the second floor, ordering a
bed from another room. The feeble woman was
then carried up and placed comfortably at rest in
her own home. The doctor came and, against my
earnest protest, insisted on stopping the stimulants
at once, saying he knew her constitution
better than I. When her husband appeared he
showed no particular interest save to take possession
of her pocketbook, and I did not see him again.</p>

<p>A Mr. and Mrs. Green showed much interest for
the woman. They kindly took me to their home
for rest. Later in the day I went back to see the
fast failing woman, who died two days later, a
victim to the conceit of an ignorant doctor. I enjoyed
for a day or two the hospitality of the
Greens, and I shall never forget their home-grown
strawberries and cream.

<h3>THE UNIQUE CASE OF WILLIAM MUDGE OF
LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> narrow-breasted, delicate boy of about
twenty-one years, enlisted in the Thirty-third
Massachusetts Infantry, and, with his
regiment, went into the battle of Chancellorsville
on Sunday morning, May <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>, 1863. After once regaining
the field they were defeated with considerable
loss in prisoners and many wounded. Mudge
fell by a shot passing entirely through his head,
cutting both optic nerves. A friend in the regiment
from his city, tied a handkerchief about his
head and left him to die, then ran to join his regiment,
fearing capture by the enemy. As soon as
a chance offered he wrote to Mudge’s father, who
was president of a Lynn bank, telling him that his
son had been left dying on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Mr. Mudge started at once to find the dead body
of his son, and succeeded in reaching the Confederate
lines, where they began to search for the
body, which could not be found on the battlefield.
The boy was at last discovered alive, lying
neglected in the Confederate field hospital.</p>

<p>It was often impossible for the surgeons and detailed
nurses to care for all the wounded, and so
they gave their time to those having a chance of
living, which poor Mudge certainly did not seem to
have. The gunshot wound had caused his face to
turn quite black, so that his father, in hunting
among the hopelessly wounded, did not recognize
him; but the boy knew his father’s voice and called
out, and so was rescued from a slow death. Mudge
told his story to me essentially as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_072.jpg"
 alt="WILLIAM MUDGE">
 <p class="caption">WILLIAM MUDGE</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“I lay all night on the field, drenched by a
shower (which often happens after a battle). In
the morning Confederate soldiers were detailed to
bury the dead, and were preparing to carry me to
the open trench near by. When I spoke to them
feebly they gave me water from a canteen, and left
me, feeling sure I would die before morning.
Imagine what a night that must have been! The
brushwood near where I was lying took fire, and
I narrowly escaped being burned to death. When
the men came on the third day to bury the dead, I
had become so weak I could only move my little
finger to show life. The Johnnies then said—&#8203;‘This
fellow is good stuff, let’s take him in.’”</p>

<p>It was easy for the father to get permission to
take away this apparently dying prisoner. Going
by easy stages to Washington, it was found on examination
that the boy was permanently blind and
had lost an eye. His skull was said to have been
fractured so that there were not two inches of solid
cranium, the jaw bones and teeth were destroyed.</p>

<p>Surgeons with much skill trepanned a hole in the
skull with a silver plate, and with the assistance of
skilled dentists, they manufactured jaw bones and
teeth. They had fitted him with a glass eye, and
green glasses to cover the defects, so that some
months after, when I met him at the New England
Rooms, he had the appearance of a well-dressed,
refined, though rather frail blind man.</p>

<p>During the fair I had taken care of him and
walked him about the great halls explaining many
things that he could not, of course, see or understand,
and he came to consider my opinions final.
He carried to his home in Lynn about three
hundred dollars from the fair subscription and
other benevolent sources.</p>

<p>A few weeks later his mother wrote me, saying
that William had become so unhappy and irritable
that they could not manage him, and he had so
often said that if Miss Smith were there, she would
know what would make him more contented.
Mrs. Mudge begged me to come, if only for a short
visit. This I could not well refuse; and I found a
pleasant refined family in a comfortable home of
their own. Mr. Mudge, William’s father, was a
gentleman and a bank president. I will digress
here for a few words on an observation, quite surprising
to me. Early on Sunday morning I saw
Mr. Mudge and several other gentlemen coming up
the street, each carrying a newspaper and two
large bundles. This seemed quite strange, but
was explained at breakfast by the inevitable down-east
baked beans in a crock, and a loaf of hot brown
bread which had been at the bake shop all night.
It was the custom for gentlemen to bring them
home on Sunday morning. Certainly they were
delicious. Being of New York blood, I was not
“au fait” on the customs regarding baked beans
and brown bread.</p>

<p>William’s mother told me that he was almost
transformed when under my influence. His was a
restless nervous temperament, and this, added to
his blindness, made life miserable. His fastidious
tastes and conventionality continued. One Sunday,
in church, he whispered, “Is my back hair
parted straight?”—&#8203;this being the style for men
at that time. And again, “Am I holding my
prayer-book right side up?” He needed occupation;
but what could the blind boy do?</p>

<p>Accidentally I saw in a newspaper an advertisement
for young men to sell a book of the early
history of the war, and I proposed to Mudge that
he could sell this book. But his aristocratic ideas
were hard to overcome, until I insinuated that he
might have a valet to carry the books and take care
of him. This modified his ideas on my suggestion.</p>

<p>His memory of locality was surprising. When
he escorted me to Boston “to see the town” he
would say, “Now over there is the bird-cage (a
shop) and there is the flat-iron sign, so we must go
this way.” Only once he failed, and then he said
we must go back to the bird-cage, after which we
started again all right.</p>

<p>I went with him to Boston, and had an interview
with the agent, who was greatly pleased to
have a martyr of the war to sell the book. I imperatively
urged Mudge to start at once, which he
did with his valet the next day; when I also left
Lynn. He wrote from memory in a good clear
hand, with a little slat to guide his pen, of his
phenomenal success, which was such as we expected.
During his tour about Massachusetts he
called at the home of the poet Longfellow, who
sent me a much prized photograph with his autograph.</p>

<p>Many bought of the poor boy, out of sympathy
and patriotism, this very imperfect book, which,
doubtless, they never read. In the course of a year
he again wrote that he had opened a stationery
store in Lynn, and was doing a good business; and
later he employed four clerks. Still later I was
dumbfounded on receiving an announcement of his
marriage.</p>

<p>Three years after, when I visited their pretty
cottage on Lynn Beach, near that of Fanny Davenport
the actress, William was not at home, but I
saw his charming wife and their handsome,
healthy boy of sixteen months.

<h3>THE START FOR THE FRONT</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Woman should take to her soul a strong purpose,
and then make circumstances conform to that purpose.”</p>

<p class="right r2">
SUSAN B. ANTHONY.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">My</span> work for sick soldiers began early in
1862, in the “Department of the East,”
which included Long Island Hospital,
Willett’s Point, David’s Island, Fort Schuyler and
Bedloe’s Island (now Liberty); all of these hospitals
being in charge of Surgeon McDougall.</p>

<p>This extensive experience prepared me for work
at the front, which, after many futile efforts, I
could now reach through a society known as
“Masonic Mission,” by which a pass was secured
from General Ben Butler for myself and three assistant
nurses, and which gave me the anxiously
desired privilege and authority of going to the
“front,” with these nurses, who were quite unknown
to me.</p>

<p>We sailed July 24th, 1864, on the Patapsco, a
government transport that had carried sick soldiers
to New York, and was returning to City Point for
orders, and were the only passengers on board.</p>

<p>Fatigue and the odor of bilge water induced intense
<span lang="fr">“mal de mer,”</span> which, added to insubordination
on the part of two of my assistants, caused
the usual distress and despair.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of my state room was intolerable,
and the captain kindly ordered a mattress
placed on deck for me, where I was comparatively
comfortable until I was obliged to stagger below
on hearing of unseemly conduct on the part of the
two nurses. I threatened, with good effect, to
have the captain put them ashore at the first island
we came to. Fortunately they did not know that
we would sight no island on that short voyage.
The third assistant, good Mrs. Dunbar, in her
kindly, motherly way, was my only comfort.</p>

<p>The captain had tried, in vain, to arouse me by
an alarm that the Alabama was chasing us. But
sea-sickness knows not even the law of self-preservation,
and I replied, “I’d as lief as not go down
by the Alabama or in any other way.”</p>

<p>At night I refused to go below to my stateroom
and bilge water odor, quite regardless of the captain’s
perplexity. After some hesitancy, however,
he gave me the only stateroom on deck. This was
filled with the accoutrements of a Confederate
officer whom, as a prisoner of war, the captain had
just delivered over to the government prison at
Fort Lafayette, in the narrows of New York Bay.
I awoke at night in such perfect peace and comfort
that for a time I imagined the Alabama had really
run us down, and that I was now happy in heaven.</p>

<p>My stateroom door had been left open for air,
and, stepping out on deck, I found there was no
motion or sound, save a soft ripple of water against
the bow. A full perfect moon cast a broad silvery
path across the quiet waters, so intense that it
seemed quite possible that Jesus had indeed
walked upon the Sea of Galilee. There was no
one in sight, nor was there a sound of anything
living or moving, though the “watch” probably
saw me leaning over the railing. We had anchored
at the mouth of the James River, waiting for the
pilot.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 29th, we again anchored,
this time before City Point, Virginia, at the junction
of the James and Appomatox Rivers, headquarters
of the United States armies in the field
under command of General Grant.</p>

<p>I went ashore in a little boat with the captain,
and reported to the Provost Marshall at headquarters,
to show my pass from General Butler. The
camp appeared rather shabby. There were only a
few wooden buildings, used by army officers, a
number of large tents and negro cabins, with
guards and officers running from one tent to another.
City Point was a barren, almost treeless
country of untilled land. The United States flag
floated over a small house used by General Grant
as headquarters.</p>

<p>A small narrow, cigar-shaped, back-wheel boat,
the “Gazelle,” returned with me to the “Patapsco,”
and taking on board the three nurses we
steamed up the narrow Appomatox River, a
monotonous sail of six miles between low bluffs
and sparse foliage, to the hospital tents at Point of
Rocks, which were pitched on the very brink of
this malarious stream. This was General Butler’s
Hospital Department of the James.</p>

<p>For the first time I realized my strange position,
and felt, when the “Patapsco” was out of sight, as
if “I had burned my bridges behind me.” There
were only half a dozen men and officers aboard.
Feeling impelled to speak to a refined-looking man,
wearing major’s shoulder-straps, I found him very
courteous. I remarked on my apprehension of the
strangeness of the situation, and said if I could feel
assured that the surgeon in charge of Point of
Rocks Hospital was a gentleman, I should have
nothing to fear. I asked the Major if he knew that
officer; he replied that he did, and thought I would
find him a gentleman.</p>

<p>On reaching Point of Rocks Hospital, the Major
offered to go ashore and send an ambulance for us,
and this took us a short distance to the hospital
tent wards, and to a small frame house near to the
Hospital Headquarters.</p>

<p>I called a passing orderly and reported at once
with my Butler pass, to the officer in charge, and
found, to my consternation, while the color rose to
the roots of my hair, that this man was the very
Major to whom I had spoken on the boat. Rising
and bowing politely he said, “Miss Smith, I trust
you will always find me a gentleman.”</p>

<p>It was well for me that he was a gentleman, for I
found myself in a very anomalous position, having
been sent by the Masonic Mission to take the place
of Clara Barton, who was already in charge of this
work, but away at the time. I soon discovered
that the Masonic Mission had taken advantage of
Miss Barton’s absence and—&#8203;quite without authority—&#8203;had
sent me to take her place. The
Major, Surgeon Porter, however, courteously invited
me to remain until her return.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had ordered a large tent put up for
my assistants and, as a compliment, assigned me to
a room at headquarters. But sleeping with a
strange fat woman on a feather-bed, with windows
closed on a hot July night was too much honor;
so the next morning I asked to be allowed to go
with the nurses in their large new tent, where, with
a cot in each corner, we were quite comfortable.
A small tent was attached for my mess-room, while
the nurses ate at the “patients’ mess.”</p>

<p>General Butler’s army headquarters of the Department
of the James, was across the Appomattox,
at Bermuda Hundreds, whence the rumbling of
wagons and tramping of troops over pontoon
bridges could be heard through the silence and
darkness of the night. Of course I slept little on
my first night in camp.</p>

<p>The next night I was greatly distressed by
groans and cries in the distance and, much excited,
I went directly to Surgeon Porter, as early as allowable
the next morning, to ask if I could do
something for the suffering soldiers. Seeming surprised
at my question he replied that he was not
aware of such suffering in camp. He asked where
the sounds came from, and as I indicated the direction
he said with a curious expression: “Well,
Miss Smith, you may try if you wish, but the cries
come from the mules in the corral, and I fear you
will not succeed.” That joke followed me wherever
I went.</p>

<p>Surgeon Porter gave me charge of the officers’
ward, of perhaps forty or more patients. Each
officer having his own orderly in attendance, and
the hospital being in very good running order,
there was no unpleasant work for me to do. So at
first I saw only the romantic side of “bathing
feverish brows,” and giving comforting words,
with some specially prepared diet.</p>

<p>Not caring for society, or mere sentiment, I soon
resolved to ask for a ward of private soldiers, who
did not presume upon equality, though many of
them were as truly gentlemen as were their officers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three nurses, though untrained,
like most nurses of that time, did good work in the
wards of the regular soldiers.

<h3>SOME PATIENTS</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Point</span> of Rocks Hospital consisted of
about a dozen tents, each perhaps fifty feet
long, pinned as usual to the ground with
wooden pegs. These contained bunks and cots on
either side, for about forty or more patients to each
tent, and sometimes, when crowded, patients had
only straw or hay bags with a blanket on the bare
ground, all of which the men nurses were expected
to keep in perfect order and cleanliness.</p>

<p>To enter at one end of these tents and see the
rows of sick and suffering, despondent men, at once
aroused an earnest desire to help them to a little
comfort and cheer.</p>

<p>One day, passing through a long ward, I was
startled by the sight of a little pinched face with
great dark eyes, that looked as if its owner might
be about ten or twelve years old. Stepping quickly
to the cot I said, “Why, who are you, and where
did you come from?”</p>

<p>A feeble voice replied, “I’m Willie, I was here
yesterday when you passed, but you didn’t look at
me.”</p>

<p>“But where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“I belong to the 37th New Jersey Infantry, in
camp a few miles off, and I got sick and they
brought me here.”
</p>

<p>“How could you be enlisted? How old are
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m fifteen. I lied, and swore I was eighteen,
and my parents wouldn’t let me go, so I ran away,
an’—&#8203;an’ I guess, I’ll never see mother any more.”</p>

<p>The soldier nurse said he was a typhoid case,
with a chance of living, if he could have good care,
but that he would not be persuaded to eat. I returned
to him at once, saying, “Willie, I hear that
you don’t eat anything.”</p>

<p>“I can’t eat.”</p>

<p>“O, but you must. Now, Willie, can’t you think
of something you’d like?”</p>

<p>“Well,” with a suppressed sob, “if I could get
anything like mother used to make, perhaps I
could.”</p>

<p>“Now tell me, Willie, what it was, what did it
look like, and how did it taste?”</p>

<p>The sick boy’s description was not very clear,
but I said cheerfully, “O, I can make that,” and
ran off to my tent and soon prepared something
which, with a silver cup, spoon, and a tidy serviette,
at least looked inviting in contrast with the battered
tin cups and plates of camp life. He showed
some interest as I said, “Here, Willie, is just what
mother used to make.” And he took a few spoonfuls
quite cheerfully as I fed him. I asked if it did
not taste something like mother made. He thought
it did.</p>

<p>Feeling sure that only the greatest care would
save him, I went at once to Surgeon Porter, saying,
“Doctor, I’d like to have that boy, Willie, for an
orderly.”</p>

<p>“What, another?” he replied, laughing. “You
have more orderlies now than General Grant himself.”</p>

<p>“This is true, doctor,” I said, for I had four who
had been assigned to me by the doctor that they
might have special care, “and not one of them can
stand alone for one hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may have him, and I wish you success.”</p>

<p>I then asked Willie if he would like to be my
orderly, and he seemed quite delighted. I directed
the nurse to dress him early next morning, and to
let him lie down till I came for him. The poor boy
staggered to his feet, but we almost carried him to
my tent, where I removed his army shoes and put
a pair of my slippers on his poor, little thin feet. I
then laid him on my cot, bathed his hot head, neck
and hands, gave him nourishment, and told him to
try to sleep while I was away caring for other patients.
All this was repeated for several days, and
thus he escaped the sight of dying and suffering
men. Each night I took him back to his tent,
where he slept soundly until morning. He improved
slowly.</p>

<p>One day, while taking my dinner alone in my
little mess tent, I was surprised to see him standing
at “attention” beside me. “Miss Smith,” he said,
while the fever burned his cheeks and brightened
his dark eyes, “I’ve been here five days, and it’s
time I did something for you.” The fever had
burned out for the time, and, turning quickly I
caught his falling, emaciated form. Realizing his
own helplessness, the poor child wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his youthful officers had come to see
him, which greatly pleased the poor boy. He improved
very slowly, but evidently would not quite
recover in these surroundings. I decided to make
an effort to send him home as soon as possible.
With permission of Surgeon Porter, and with his
ambulance and an orderly, I rode a few miles to a
camp of the 37th New Jersey Infantry, in the
woods, which was composed entirely of boys and
officers of not more than twenty or twenty-four
years of age.</p>

<p>The little “dog” or A tents allowed only one to
crawl in on either side of the tent pole, and lie on
his blankets on the bare ground with knapsacks for
pillows. No wonder malaria made havoc in their
ranks!</p>

<p>While I was there, an order came to send forward
a small detachment of men for picket duty.
All clamored to go, shouting in a most informal
manner, quite regardless of discipline. “Say, Cap,
let me go.” “I say, Maj, you know me.” “Cap,
let me go, won’t you?” etc., etc. A dozen men
were selected, not one fully grown, and these boys
staggered off in high spirits, each carrying a knapsack
weighing sixty pounds, a gun and an overcoat.</p>

<p>The colonel and captain of this regiment very
cheerfully made the necessary application for a sick
furlough, and on my return to camp Surgeon Porter
at once endorsed it. Then, having waited a few
days for some one to take charge of Willie, I had
the satisfaction of seeing him start in an ambulance
for the boat at City Point, supplied with brandy
and nourishment. His head lay on the knee of an
officer who was going to Fortress Monroe, and
there was a happy boyish smile on his face as they
drove away.</p>

<p>In a few weeks came the good news that he had
reached home and mother and was fast recovering.</p>

<p>In the same ward with Willie were a number of
Ohio “ninety days selected men,” chiefly farmers,
nearly every man six feet or more in height. They
were typhoid cases, who were really suffering
more from nostalgia than from fever. They had
already served half their term, yet nothing could
arouse them from despair and homesickness, from
which many of them actually died, while the wiry,
irrepressible city boys generally recovered.</p>

<p>One day, while I was trying to bathe away the
fever from the head and hands of a young officer,
General Butler entered the tent with some of his
staff, and thanked me for my care of this favorite,
asking that I would do all in my power to make him
comfortable.</p>

<p>Another patient, Chaplain Eaton, of a Connecticut
regiment, was recovering from typhoid, and,
though not very ill at this time, still claimed a good
deal of my attention. I felt, however, that it was
a waste of time to spend many minutes talking with
him, or in reading the Bible to him, while so many
others were really suffering and needing special
care. But I wrote to his wife and did what I could.
He was very grateful, and wished to prove it by
presenting to me a handsome black horse, that his
orderly brought daily to the tent for inspection and
petting. The animal was so intelligent that he
seemed really to recognize me. The chaplain’s insistence
upon my accepting the horse was quite
annoying; and at last I said to him that “it would
be a great pity to turn such a beautiful creature into
an ‘elephant’, which he would certainly become on
my hands.”

<h3>EXPERIENCES AT POINT OF ROCKS</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> Miss Barton’s return I found myself very
much “de trop,” though she treated me
kindly. I saw very little of her work, but
her extreme deliberation, when one day I had run
to her quite breathless from the operating tent for
bandages, etc., for the surgeons who were waiting,
was very irritating. She asked about my health,
urged me to take a seat, and very slowly rummaged
about for the necessary supplies. The only time I
saw her actively engaged was on a day when there
had been a skirmish at the front, and she started
for the field with the ambulance and an orderly, and
a small box of bandages, condensed milk, etc.</p>

<p>One bright moonlight night, I was startled by
strange sounds of melodious singing in the distance,
and, with an orderly, I went to ascertain its
meaning. We soon came upon a large fire surrounded
by a circle of perhaps forty negroes, men
and women, crooning and singing. They were
often led by a high falsetto, then sinking to a low
monotone, when suddenly another voice would rise
changing to a new refrain, while not one lost the
time or pitch or made discords. They danced hand
in hand in a slow rythmic circle, while one, more
excited than the rest, would spring up to a remarkable
height shouting, “Glory! bress de Lawd!”
“I’s a-comin’ Lawd!” etc. All “eyes in a fine
frenzy rolling,” shone like great black beads in the
firelight, while their white teeth gleamed brightly.
All were in solemn seriousness as they sang simple
couplets like the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“If I’d a died when I was young,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I wouldn’t a had dis risk to run.”</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Some folks is bery good on de sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But dey don’t know nuffin ’bout de hebbenly King.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Some folks is bery good on de talk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But dey don’t know nuffin ’bout de hebbenly walk.”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>They continued on in childish simplicity till their
ecstasy broke into shouts of “Cum down Lawd!”—&#8203;“I’s
a comin’ Lawd! Look out for me!”—&#8203;“I’s
a-waitin’ Lawd!”—&#8203;while the circle whirled
in dizzy speed until they sometimes fell exhausted
to the ground. All feared the “Voodou-Cunger”
woman, and were anxious to propitiate her with a
rabbit’s foot and various incantations.</p>

<p>Eloquence, rhythm, oratory and harmony seem
inborn among this strange people, who have given
to the whole South the soft voice and accent so
many of us like to hear.</p>

<p>Under existing conditions it was a relief when
Mrs. <span class="lock">E——</span> came from the Masonic Mission in New
York and claimed that a mistake had been made in
sending me to Point of Rocks, and informed me
that I would find work to my liking at City Point.</p>

<p>The following day Mrs. <span class="lock">E——,</span> with an ambulance,
took me for a day’s rough travel over corduroy
roads and ditches and through woods to General
Burnside’s 9th Corps headquarters in a clump
of trees before Petersburg. The General came out
of an inner tent, putting on his coat and apologizing,
saying he had been sleeping.</p>

<p>“Why, General, how can you sleep with the
shells screaming and exploding so near?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he replied, laughingly, “this is when I
can sleep comfortably. It’s only when I hear musketry
that I fear there is mischief brewing.”</p>

<p>A very courteous, handsome, soldierly gentleman
was General Burnside.</p>

<p>We then drove a short distance to General O. B.
Wilcox’s headquarters, so near Petersburg that,
with the General’s glasses, I could distinctly see the
people in their houses at their daily work, though
the cannons on both sides were replying with a
formality as if war was a matter of etiquette.
There seemed to be only women in the town, going
about their home duties, quite unconscious of shells
falling into their doomed city. The General was
quite elated at having that day moved his lines forward
three-quarters of a mile.</p>

<p>Seeing a number of barrels piled before his tent,
I asked why they were there. He smiled and said,
“I was sitting here awhile ago when a bullet
passed over my shoulder, and the boys were afraid
a sharpshooter might pick me off, so they piled
these barrels up for protection.”</p>

<p>General Burnside commanded the 9th Army
Corps and General Wilcox the second division of
that Corps. Both were gentlemen of refinement
and great kindness to the men, who were very
proud and fond of their commanders. I observed
that both Generals treated me with more courtesy
than they showed to Mrs. <span class="lock">E——,</span> although she was
a much older woman.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The next day on leaving the hospital at Point of
Rocks, after thanking Surgeon Porter for his
friendliness and attention that had made my stay
possible and pleasant, and bidding Miss Barton
good-bye, I went with Mrs. <span class="lock">E——</span> on board the
“Gazelle,” (then well known in New York Bay),—&#8203;and
returned to City Point.
</p>

<p>We went directly to the tent of a Miss Nye, on
the Agency Row, whom I recognized as having
seen in the office of the Masonic Mission in New
York City. Miss Nye at once took me aside saying,
“You had better take off that badge,”—&#8203;the
badge of the Masonic Mission, which I had worn
for protection,—&#8203;“it is not respected here, and
you may stay with me as long as you wish, but that
woman cannot stay another night in my tent.”</p>

<p>About midnight a terrific storm arose and threatened
to sweep Miss Nye’s tent into the ravine quite
nearby. She called for help from the next tent,
where slept some Christian Commission agents.
While Miss Nye held on to one side of the tent, I
threw myself across my cot and, with all my
strength, held on to the other side. Mrs. <span class="lock">E——</span> in
a short gown and petticoat of the olden time, held
the tent flaps as the wind rushed through, nearly
carrying us all away with the tents. However, the
men soon hammered down the tent pins securely,
and all was quiet again. Altogether we made a
comical picture and would have been a fine group
for the present day kodak.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="lock">E——</span> left City Point the next day, and so
passed out of my life.</p>

<p>While I was yet with Miss Nye, another night of
alarm ended rather amusingly. We were sleeping
soundly on opposite sides of the tent when Miss
Nye screamed out that some one had reached under
the tent and touched her hand. We got up
and, after talking loudly for a while, thought the
intruder was scared off. Then we fell asleep. He
came back again, however, evidently trying to
reach a pocket book under Miss Nye’s pillow.
This time, not wishing to disturb the sleepers in
the near tents, we concluded to “arm ourselves for
the fray.” Miss Nye found a hatchet which she
would have used bravely. I could find no defensive
weapon but a big long-necked bottle. We knew
that the thief could hear our threatening talk as he
was hiding in the ravine close by, so we lay down
again, Miss Nye clasping the hatchet on her breast,
and I embracing in like manner my big bottle.
We soon slept soundly again, when suddenly a terrific
crash caused us to spring up in alarm. What
could it be? Then I realized that I had relaxed
my hold on the big bottle, which had rolled across
the rough floor and crashed against the tent pole.
After indulging in a good laugh over our fright, we
slept soundly once more until morning.</p>

<p>Still another incident regarding Miss Nye comes
to mind. Years after the war I succeeded in finding
her, then a graduate of homœopathy in New
York City,—&#8203;Doctor Frances M. Nye. She had
met a Confederate soldier, also a graduate of this
school of medicine, and also bearing the name of
Francis M. Nye. The identity of names, perhaps,
induced a lasting friendship, and when they married
Miss Nye changed only one letter in her name.
They continued to practise together for many years
and seemed very happy.

<h3>DEPOT FIELD HOSPITAL AND STATE AGENCIES
AT CITY POINT, VIRGINIA</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> hospital was situated half a mile from
General Grant’s headquarters at City Point,
at the junction of the James and Appomatox
Rivers, and about eight miles from Petersburg
front. The hospital camp, then under the charge
of Surgeon Edward Dalton and medical staff, was
laid out with great precision. This field hospital
was divided into the 9th, <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>, 6th, 5th corps, and
corps d’Afric, and these again into divisions, avenues,
and streets at right angles,—&#8203;numbered and
lettered. There were many thousands of sick and
wounded in these wards, nine thousand or more at
a time, I believe.</p>

<p>Convalescent soldiers did police, ward, nurse and
kitchen duty. There were hundreds of wards with
stockade sides, covered with canvas roofs upheld
in the usual manner by ridge and tent poles, each
containing probably fifty or more bunks or cots.
A perfect system of order and policing by convalescent
men was enforced, and not a particle of
refuse or any scrap was allowed to lie for a moment
upon the immaculate streets or avenues of the
“Sacred Soil,” which was generally beaten hard
and dry, though in wet weather this was a problem
to try men’s souls and women’s soles too. At such
times we were obliged to wade through nearly a
foot of liquid mud, occasionally sticking fast till
pulled out somehow, perhaps with the loss of a
high rubber boot.</p>

<p>The wards were wonders of cleanliness, considering
the disadvantages of field life, and even at
that time sanitation was of a high order and, to a
great degree, prevented local diseases. Men
nurses, soldiers unfit for active duty, took pleasure
in fixing up their wards with an attempt at ornamentation,
when allowed. These men well deserved
their pay, as they worked cheerfully for the
government and for their sick comrades, doing
their part faithfully during the devastations of war.
They were as much needed and as necessary as
their heroic comrades in the field. I never knew
of one of these faithful, hard-working amateur
nurses being guilty of neglect or unkindness,
though chronic growlers and irritable sick men
were often exasperating to the nurse’s unfailing
care and patience. They frequently conveyed
some interdicted luxuries from the sutler, or extra
rations, to make life more endurable and comfortable
for the invalids. This was usually winked at
by their officers. They were generally appreciated,
and little dissatisfaction or complaint could
have been expressed. Perfect discipline and sympathy
seemed to prevail.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_098.jpg"

 <p class="caption">SANITARY COMMISSION TENT AT CITY POINT</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>During my year in this Field Hospital I did not
hear of any enforcement of severe punishment, but
I remember, one day, while riding outside of hospital
lines, past a post or camp in the woods, seeing
in the distance a poor fellow hanging by his thumbs
to the branch of a tree. It was said by the men of
his regiment that “the fellow ought to have been
hanged.”</p>

<p>Just across the road on one side of the hospital
was a row of State Agency tents. Larger tents of
the Sanitary Commission,—&#8203;that magnanimous
gift of the people that so often, even in the far
South, so nobly supplemented the regular hospital
work and supplies, sometimes even with its own
transports and its own official corps of workers,—&#8203;headed
this row. In the middle of the Agency row
were the tents of the Christian Commission, supported
chiefly by churches from all over the Northern
States. They had built a large rough wooden
structure where regular services were held on Sundays
and on many evenings during the week, to the
great relief and enjoyment of weary men seeking
to find a word of hope and comfort, and a change
from the monotony of ward life. Many ministers
and other speakers came to look over the work,
and many of them were very interesting and
earnest.</p>

<p>Along this extensive row of tents were the
Agencies, supported by the liberality of their several
States, which also supplemented the government
in giving special care to their own individual
men. Capable men and refined women workers
toiled uncomplainingly to make hospital life more
endurable for the sick.
</p>

<p>From Petersburg front sick and wounded were
daily sent to the hospital, often on rough flat sand
cars, over badly laid shaking tracks, being brought
as hastily as possible that they might receive
proper care and help. The sight of these cars,
loaded with sufferers as they lay piled like logs,
waiting their turn to be carried to the wards,—&#8203;powder-stained,
dust-begrimed, in ragged torn and
blood-stained uniforms, with here and there a half-severed
limb dangling from a mutilated body,—&#8203;was
a gruesome, sickening one, never to be forgotten,
and one which I tried not to see when unable
to render assistance.</p>

<p>Not only were the sick and wounded from near
by brought there, but large numbers came from
more southerly points of the army of the Potomac.
Many seriously or permanently injured were sent
here to wait until able to be forwarded to Washington.
Some came en route on sick furloughs, or
to be discharged, or when fit returned to their regiments
in the field. Every grade of suffering or
weariness found temporary shelter and care here.
All incurable cases were hurried forward as soon
as possible to make room for the multitude still
coming.</p>

<p>One day while I was passing through a large
ward, a number of sick and wounded men were
brought in. Suddenly one of them,—&#8203;a boy of
about eighteen,—&#8203;stood before me at “attention.”
Signs of typhoid were only too evident, as
quite wildly, he struggled to express himself, much
like the following:</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss, won’t you just take my name? It’s
John C. Guffin; and write to my parents and tell
them about me?” Controlling himself with an
effort he continued: “And Oh, do write to my employer,
Mr. Gibson, in Albany, and now, now be
quick, won’t you?”—&#8203;always prepared for such
emergencies, I quickly took down these addresses,—&#8203;“for
in a minute I won’t know anything, just
like I was when they brought me in.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_101.jpg"
 alt="John Guffin">
 <p class="caption">JOHN C. GUFFIN</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>With a painful struggle he controlled his mind,
saying: “Just take these” (small articles) “and
this little watch and wear it until I get well.”
This intense strain exhausted the last gleam of intelligence,
and he fell unconscious on a cot near by.
Many weeks he lay, raving and incoherent, till the
fever had spent its malign power. During these
weeks I had many times stopped to glance at the
poor fellow, with burning fever and his eyes rolling
wildly; but I could do little for him. The soldier
nurses, always kind to their sick comrades, did all
that was necessary or possible.</p>

<p>At this crisis Dr. O’Maugher came to me in the
Maine State Agency saying, “Do you remember
the boy Guffin? Well the fever has spent itself,
and he is now lying in a critical state of exhaustion,
refusing all nourishment. I know you are over-worked,
but he is at a point when only a woman’s
care can pull him through. Can you make a place
for him on your list?”</p>

<p>I went as soon as possible to the emaciated patient,
whose mind was not yet quite clear, though
he seemed at once to have confidence in me and
wished me to stay by his side. Losing no time, I
said: “Why, John, I hear you will not eat anything,
and now if you will not eat you will certainly
relapse and die.”</p>

<p>“I can’t eat, I can’t eat,” he continued to repeat.</p>

<p>“Why not?” I asked. “Why can’t you eat?”</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “these ain’t John C. Guffin’s
teeth, and I can’t eat, I can’t eat.”</p>

<p>Here was a problem. The boy must not be
forced against his own will. “Why, my boy,
that’s nonsense, because you have had a bad fever.”</p>

<p>He repeated, “Can’t eat, can’t eat; these ain’t
my teeth, and I can’t eat with another man’s
teeth.”</p>

<p>Experience had taught us many devices while in
our daily care of irresponsible patients, so I replied
quickly, “O, that makes no difference, don’t
you know you can eat just as well with another
man’s teeth as with your own?”—&#8203;a fact painfully
true to many. He turned and looked at me
very doubtfully while I repeated and urged him to
try. “Now, John, I’m going to make something
real nice for you, and you are going to eat it.”</p>

<p>Very soon I brought my little tray, with silver
cup and spoon and a pretty doily, in which for refined
patients I had much confidence, and which at
once diverted their attention. When I sat down
beside him he said once more to me rather quietly,
“Can’t eat, can’t eat.”</p>

<p>“Now, John, I made this just for you; it’s
awfully good, taste it.”</p>

<p>Taking advantage of an open-mouthed objection,
I slipped in a spoonful which he was obliged
to swallow, greatly to his surprise; and so I quickly
followed it with two or three more spoonfuls, and
left the little tray for him to look at, and to help
him to reason out why he could eat with another
man’s teeth.</p>

<p>Daily I fed him until he was able to take the
regular hospital diet. While convalescent, and
when quite himself, we had almost a quarrel. I
wished to return the little silver watch, and he insisted
upon my keeping it, this I refused until he
declared that it was not good enough, and if I
would not keep it he would send me a handsome
gold one when he reached home. At last I consented
to accept it as a keepsake from a boy friend,
saying I would rather have it than a gold one. To
my great regret, while galloping with a party
through Petersburg, just after the capture, I lost
it from my belt, with a bunch of rings made from
buttons, and little tokens made by the boys from
the bones of the meat in their rations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had written to his family and to his
employer, Mr. Gibson, who wrote that if the boy
could be taken home he would come for him. Immediately
I wrote and explained to him what was
necessary to procure a discharge or sick furlough.
The former was soon obtained, as he was even then
but a boy. Mr. Gibson came at once, and took the
lad home in a most generous manner.</p>

<p>When, later, I went to Albany for an interview
with Governor Fenton, I was entertained by his
family; but John was not at home, and I have
never seen him since.</p>

<p>During this period of the great Rebellion the
most terrible battles of any recorded in modern
history, were fought. After one of them, during
which the same ground had been fought over repeatedly,
now with success on the Southern side,
now on the Northern, a flag of truce was sent in
from the Confederate Army, asking for a cessation
of hostilities that its soldiers might be allowed to
bury their dead. The following poem, written by
Amanda T. Jones, author of “A Psychic Autobiography,”

<p>I found plenty of work to do, and attached myself
to the Ninth Corps especially, though visiting
all the wards and corps. I was invited by Mrs.
Mayhew to work with her for some weeks in the
Maine State Agency. While there I was asked
later, in the absence of Miss Gilson, of Lynn, Massachusetts,
to take charge of the Corps d’Afric, but
I soon found that the work was chiefly to look after
refugee negroes, and to give them employment in
laundry work, etc. Doctor Thomas Pooley was
then in charge of that corps, and is now a distinguished
oculist of Manhattan. I still see him,
a very young man, resplendent in a new uniform
with bright buttons, red sash, etc., as officer of the
day.</p>

<p>Miss Gilson had come with Mr. Fay, General
Superintendent of the Sanitary Commission, in the
field, and formerly Mayor of Chelsea, Massachusetts,
and she chose to work for the Corps d’Afric.
That was quite as well conducted as any other
corps. Miss Gilson was a dainty young woman,
and, while in camp, wore a short pretty dress of
grey cloth and a white kerchief tastily arranged
over her dark hair and one about her neck. She
had a pure soprano voice, and frequently sang
army songs and hymns to the men, making them
quite happy, and with a sort of reverence, they
seemed to find her an angel of peace. In her
earnest devotion, Miss Gilson remained too long
ministering to typhoid patients from whom she
contracted the fever, and at last was compelled to
leave her chosen work and go to her home, still
hoping to recover and to return to the patients of
her corps. Her strength was not equal to the
waste of that burning fever, however, and she died
in her early womanhood, a sacrifice to her benevolence
and patriotism as truly and honorably as the
men who died on the field of battle.</p>

<p>I returned to the Maine State Agency, and
found more special cases in the hospital than could
be cared for by all the ladies. The United States
Sanitary Commission was under the direction of
the late J. Yates Peek, of Brooklyn, New York.
The absence of sectarianism in their work gave
them greater freedom than was found in the work
of the “Christian Commission,” which was conducted
on “religious” principles. The latter,
however, did a very large work under the direction
of the late Mr. Henry Houghton, a distinguished
oculist of Manhattan.</p>

<p>The large wooden chapel accommodated many
hundreds, and here came preachers from all over
the country, whose churches had contributed supplies
and were anxious to know how their contributions
were applied. Some ministers, from remote
localities, were a great annoyance, having to
be entertained by the Christian Commission, and
wanting to regulate their donations according to
the ideas of their own little parishes.</p>

<p>In the Maine State Agency the “mess” was at
that time composed of Mrs. Mayhew and her lady
assistants, with two or three convalescent officers.
This pleasant party I was invited to join.</p>

<p>Surgeon William O’Maugher, of the 69th New
York Infantry, late coroner of New York City, a
jolly Irish gentleman, and Lieutenant Stanwood, of
Maine, with their wit and jolly talk were a great
help to us, when we sometimes actually staggered
to our tents, completely discouraged and exhausted.
It was impossible to help all the sick
“Boys,” who were happy if we could give them
only a pleasant word of cheer in passing. We
frequently sat on the rough seats, leaning wearily
on the plank tables supported on empty barrels;
but their Yankee and Irish jokes, after a good
meal, soon raised our spirits and we were ready to
start again on the endless round among the sick.</p>

<p>One day at dinner, when I was particularly depressed,
Doctor O’Maugher began with an extra
brogue—&#8203;“Yees all think a deal of Miss Smith,
don’t yees?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we do,” said Lieutenant Stanwood,
“and no one had better say anything against
her.”</p>

<p>“Well, if yees knew what I know about her y’d
change yer mind.” I was too tired to raise my
head, and he went on: “Yees know about that
Guffin boy she tuk care of? Well, she saved his
life to be sure, but if ye knew the rist of it.”</p>

<p>At last I said, “What’s the matter with you,
O’Maugher?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he went on, “do ye know whin I
wanted to put a fly blisther on the back of the
boy’s head, she wouldn’t allow it, and for why do
ye think? Well, she said it would spoil his looks
for a corpse.” This of course was followed with
a shout of laughter which happily relaxed the
tension of fatigue, and gave us courage to go on.</p>

<p>One morning when Doctor O’Maugher came to
his “mess” he looked a picture of misery. “Why,
Doctor, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a poor miserable cuss of a biped I am
onyway.”</p>

<p>“What makes you so unhappy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just a miserable toothache that I have.”
</p>

<p>“Is that all? Well then, Doctor, you are only
a bicusped after all.”</p>

<p>“Be garry, it’s right ye are,” he laughed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayhew, a lady of much refinement, possessed
a sweet soprano voice, and a few of us
formed a chapel quartette. The singing was
greatly enjoyed by the convalescents, especially as
we took care to select good old time choruses in
which they joined heartily. Planed planks on logs
made tolerable seats, and a rough platform and a
desk, lighted at night with lamps or candles, completed
the arrangements of the great square room
of unplaned boards, where, as Miss Nye remarked,
we sometimes literally “sat under the drippings of
the sanctuary.”</p>

<p>Many evenings while resting from the fatigue of
the day we sat outside the Maine Agency tent and
sang army and other patriotic songs. Mrs. Mayhew
with her rare sweet voice led the singing, and
the chorus followed in our favorite songs of
“Picking the Lint,” “Tenting To-night,” “We
Shall Meet but We Shall Miss Him,” “Star
Spangled Banner,” “Home, Sweet Home.” The
latter, however, caused many stealthy tears among
the listening patients, so we often closed with
something cheerful like “Yankee Doodle” or
“John Brown’s Body,” etc. Owing to the quiet
of the great hospital after dark the singing could
be heard all over camp.</p>

<p>I was urged to take charge of the 2nd corps’ diet
kitchen in the absence of Miss Hancock, which
meant to direct the soldier cooks, see to supplies,
regulate hours and kitchen diet, etc., for four
hundred convalescents.</p>

<p>Late one morning the head cook came to me saying,
“It’s time to begin dinner, and we have
nothing but one little shoulder of lamb. The
Commissary has not sent any meat or vegetables.
What shall we do?”</p>

<p>This was a dilemma certainly. Four hundred
hungry men must somehow be fed. All through
the army at every camp, I believe, a temporary
oven was set up during the halts, and excellent
fresh bread was served daily. The government
also supplied the very best of coffee, but this was
not dinner. One must be equal to any emergency
in the army. Telling the cook to get out his large
cauldron and put into it the little allowance of meat
to boil, I took an orderly with a wheelbarrow, and
started on a forage among the agencies.</p>

<p>At Maine I begged some fresh vegetables.
Ohio gave some canned meat, Indiana onions, New
Jersey more canned goods. I sent the orderly
with these to the cook, directing that everything
be put into the cauldrons. We got another barrow
load from the Pennsylvania, the Christian and
the Sanitary Commissions. This miscellaneous
collection, when cooked and well seasoned, made
“the best stew we ever ate,” said the satisfied
four hundred.</p>

<p>While at this diet kitchen some one stole my
journal, money, and pass,—&#8203;the latter the most
serious loss, as no one could remain in camp without
written authority. Happily, and to my surprise,
when I applied to Surgeon Dalton as to
what I must do, he said, “As I know of your good
work in New York, Miss Smith, I will be happy to
have you remain, but hope you will get a pass as
soon as possible. The Provost Marshall, General
Patrick, has authority higher than mine.” The
General was a strict disciplinarian, and had he
known that my pass was lost he could have
ordered me to “report to Washington at once.”</p>

<p>Many strange things occurred in our daily work.
While I was helping at the Pennsylvania Agency,
a wild-eyed, simple-minded woman found her way
to our tents. Twice before she had somehow
either eluded the guards or had worried officers
into giving her a temporary pass. She had come
for “the bones of her son” who had died at White
House Landing and was supposed to have been
buried there in the early skirmishes of the war.
Hoping to satisfy this persistent woman, Mrs.
Painter, whose pass gave her authority, ordered a
transport to take her with a detachment of men to
the golgotha of her hopes.</p>

<p>We took the short sail and landed at White
House Point, where it was thought the boy might
possibly have been buried, as the men had been in
a skirmish there. They tried to locate the body
by driving down in many places a long slender
iron bar, but no trace of it was found. The half-demented
woman continued to declare that she
would “yet hold those dear bones in her arms.”
She was finally persuaded to go home and come
another time, which was the only way of relieving
the hospital of her presence.</p>

<p>According to army usage everything movable
might be taken from a deserted point. The White
House was still standing in good order, with green
lattice shutters, and Mrs. Painter directed the men
to take them off and bring them to our tents, and a
small summer house was added to our army property.

<h3>CITY POINT, VIRGINIA—A DAY IN THE ARMY</h3>

<p class="center">From a letter written Nov. 8, 1864</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">November</span> 8th (Election Day) dawned
upon a cloudy sky and misty atmosphere as
peculiar to Virginia as is also the renowned
and “Sacred Soil,” after a few days’ rain. This
however, we observed after we had risen from our
narrow hospital bed, which stood close by the side
of the tent, that flapped in the face of the sleeper
(or waker) as the wind rose or fell. The rain
descended in torrents during the night, and all was
damp as usual in our rag houses. Our sleeping
apartment, or tent, the second one of the Maine
Agency, was well stored with boxes of goods and
delicacies for the sick, leaving little moving space.
Late as was the season our tents were made comfortably
warm with army fireplaces, and stoves,
though the floors, made of broken boxes, were
sometimes covered with mud. “Oh, were you
ever into an Irishman’s shanty?” I can not here
describe our excellent agency which did more for
the relief of soldiers, and more fully realized the
idea of an army home, than any agency or commission
on the field.</p>

<p>I accepted a pressing invitation from the New
Jersey State Agent, Doctor Hettie K. Painter, to
join a pleasure excursion. She, by the by, was a
living example of the usefulness of a lady in the
army, who can frequently effect more good by
personal influence than would be allowed through
regular channels.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_117.jpg"
 alt="Hettie Painter">
 <p class="caption">DR. HETTIE K. PAINTER</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Our pass being sufficient, we started in an ambulance
with a clever driver, who drove around the
camp and gave us an opportunity to see the extent
of our hospital, having a capacity of over 9,000,
and covering an area of twenty-five acres. We
then crossed the Petersburg railroad, to which had
been added a branch running directly into the middle
of our camp for the more direct and comfortable
conveyance of the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>We splashed on in the mud, through an opening
in the fortification which protected the base. This
defense extended about fifteen miles from the Appomatox
River to the James River, and was a high,
heavy earthwork, further protected by a deep
ditch; earthworks having been found to be superior
to stone fortification. How little did those at
home know of the immense amount of labor here
necessary! The pick and spade still played an important
part in the warfare of our country.</p>

<p>Virginia was stripped of her artificial culture and
bore on her bosom the scourge of war in the form
of burned and felled woods, torn and altered roads,
plantations deserted and laid waste, deeply furrowed
fields turned into stony roughness and
corduroy unevenness, which resisted even the
indentation of wheels, and threatened frequent
overturns. With all these marks of desolation,
waste and destruction, Virginia was still beautiful
in her woods and varied trees, now gorgeous in the
oriental splendor of fall,—&#8203;crimson, orange and
pale yellow, with a background of the darkest
green, fading into tan or sere and yellow,—&#8203;with
blended colorings indescribable, and hills receding
in the distance. Near us—&#8203;beyond the winding
river and bayous, the dells and ravines and bluffs,
which give to the quiet and beautiful scenery of
this section its greatest variety and charm—&#8203;was
the Point of Rocks.</p>

<p>On we jogged in our springless ambulance, here
passing an army train of supplies, or a load of logs
for building winter quarters. Further on we ran
our wheels into a loaded army wagon, drawn by six
mules, but a dexterous turn brought us upon an
evergreen bank, and we rode safely along, following
a cavalry force. After riding about four miles,
we came to Broadway Landing, (why so called I
can not surmise), a depot at which General Butler’s
supplies were received and forwarded. Here
we crossed the pontoon bridge, formed by placing
flat-bottomed boats sidewise about ten feet apart,
and fastening these by ropes and beams laid across
from one boat to another, and heavy planks laid
transversely across the beams. This makes a very
simple, portable and strong bridge. The river at
this point is less than a quarter of a mile in width,
having a steep bank on either side.</p>

<p>On the eminence of the James River side of the
Appomattox we came upon the marine artillery performing
their drill. The rapidity with which they
dismounted, and took to pieces and reconstructed
their cannon seemed wonderful to an ordinary
spectator. To the left we passed the spot said to
be the veritable and memorable site of the historical
incident of the saving of Captain Smith’s
life by Pocahontas. Her direct descendants, the
Rolfs, give this as the locality, and the stump of a
large oak tree at the extreme end of the Point of
Rocks as the identical one,—&#8203;now felled and
lying down the bank,—&#8203;under whose shade might
have perished John Smith. And what then would
the world have done for a scapegoat?</p>

<p>Still further to the left of us was the 18th Army
Corps Hospital, and in the background, on the
river bank, rose one of General Butler’s great
signal stations, 125 feet in height, to which were
communicated from the smaller and hidden stations,
the results of their observations, and whence
they were transmitted to General Butler’s headquarters.
While at one of these smaller stations,
we saw through glasses a train of nine empty cars,
passing on the rebel road, which fact was immediately
conveyed by a singular numerical motion of a
signal flag. The flagman who gave this communication
was remarkably expert in his motions.</p>

<p>After riding some three miles further we reached
General Butler’s provisional camp, then in command
of General Graham. Only a part of the supplies
were now forwarded to this point, the rest
being conveyed by way of the James River. Here
we stopped at the Hatcher farm. Judging from
the number of barns and small houses scattered
about, this must have been quite an extensive
plantation. The owner and present occupant had
taken the Oath of Allegiance, and having sent his
slaves farther south, lived here quietly with his
wife and three pretty children. But General Butler’s
vigilance would not allow him to leave his
house or to speak to any one without the immediate
attendance of a guard, who constantly walked
before his door. Our cook supplied this rusty
cavalier and family with the necessities of life, as if
he were a northern “mud sill.”</p>

<p>On the farm was quite a large negro cabin, built
of logs, consisting of two rooms, one above the
other. This was the telegraph station of this
section and was under the supervision of the son
of Doctor Hettie K. Painter, a lad of less than
seventeen summers, who conducted the business as
thoroughly as if it had been under the guidance or
experience of grey locks. What strange stories
passed over the lines from that mysterious little
instrument, quietly working away on a side table
as if only an ornament! These boy employees,—&#8203;for
our young friend Painter had assistance,—&#8203;were
all able to read by sounds which, to unpractised
ears, seemed all alike.</p>

<p>In a large fireplace, over a log fire, Mrs. Painter
made a camp kettle of cornstarch pudding, and
George Washington, the contraband, boiled potatoes
and fried the mutton chops; and with the addition
of a few delicacies and good Java coffee,
which we had carried with us, we had as good a
dinner as hungry mortals could wish.</p>

<p>Dinner over, we gathered some of the beautiful
autumn leaves, and rode on our way until we
reached the renowned original “Crow’s Nest”
signal station. This was a huge tree seventy-five
feet high, surmounting which was the “Crow’s
Nest,” reached by rude ladders from one platform
to another. This “Nest” resembled a thatched
bird’s nest on a large scale, about four feet square,
and it was almost hidden by surrounding trees. A
new skeleton station erected on the opposite side
of the road left unused the “Old Nest.” Several
gunboats were lying in the river, below the banks
of the James, ready for action.</p>

<p>Entering the ambulance, we continued our ride
over hills and through ravines, at the risk of an
upset, until we safely reached Dutch Gap, General
Butler’s famous canal. This was nearly completed
at the cost of much time and labor, and only
waited the blasting of a rock at the other end, to
complete the work which would form an island of
the narrow peninsula dividing the River James into
two branches, to be connected by the canal.</p>

<p>Along both shores were heavy guns and strong
fortifications, quite formidable, showing much
labor and ingenuity. Despite the almost constant
courtesy of interchanging shells passing overhead,
the “Johnny Rebs,” on one side of the river, and
the Yanks on the other bank, had many quiet
talks across the narrow stream. Talks like this
were quite usual, and were even winked at by
officers.</p>

<p>“Hello Yank, hev u’uns got any good coffee?”</p>

<p>“Well I guess! It can’t be beat. Say, Johnny,
how are you off for tobac?”</p>

<p>“O, we’ve got heaps of that. I reckon u’uns
had better just float some of that coffee across.”</p>

<p>“All right, Johnny, you get your tobac ready!”
</p>

<p>By a little practice in watching the current, they
became quite expert in floating across many exchanges
besides the tobacco and coffee. They
even risked being shot from their own side as
deserters, and swam across after dark to enjoy a
supper of “hot pone” on the “Reb” side, or hot
coffee and some luxuries on the “Yank” side,
where the sutler often consumed a month’s pay at
a time in selling good things to some “Boy in
Blue.”</p>

<p>Returning, we stopped only at the embalmer’s,
where many bodies were daily prepared to be sent
to friends at home. The morbid fancy which is
manifested by so many to possess dead bodies,
especially those which have long laid buried, seems
one of the most barbarous customs permitted in a
civilized country.</p>

<p>We reached our hospital just as “night drew on
her sable mantle and pinned it with a star.” The
camp fires and chimneys were throwing over the
scene a bright and cheering glow. A good supper
was prepared by our contraband Hannah, who,
with a broad smile, declared in her own peculiar
vernacular: “I’s jes goin’ gib you alls up; t’o’t de
rebs done got you dis time shoo nuff—&#8203;I’se so
glad.”</p>

<p>We pressed our collection of leaves, and, after a
short visit to headquarters and the ladies’ tent
where our stores were kept, we returned to
“Maine” and laid away our weary bones, nearly
shattered after a day’s shaking over the corduroy
roads. We were soon lulled to sleep by the 6th
Army Corps singing “The Girl I Left Behind Me”
and the humming of the singing mice which infected
our tent.

<h3>DOROTHEA DIX</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">About</span> this time I met Dorothea Dix, that
masterful woman by whose persevering
energies insane women were provided with
suitable hospitals, instead of being confined with
criminals, as was usual in the old days. She devoted
her time, thought and influence to compelling
the opening of decent asylums for these
often refined, unfortunate women patients. Her
good work, begun in this country, reached England
and other countries, and was the beginning of that
civilizing influence that no longer considered these
unfortunates as subjects of divine punishment.</p>

<p>Miss Dix, a dignified lady, was then organizing
a trained nurse corps. There were no trained
nurses, or “Red Cross” at that time, but later we
followed the Swiss movement. Miss Dix asked
me to join her corps, but I declined, preferring to
do independent work. I was glad, however, to
turn over to her nurse corps, my three assistant
nurses, knowing that with her they would receive
pay for their services, which the Masonic Mission
had falsely promised to us. Several young girls
had been sent, with directions not to take money
or clothing, as everything would be furnished. I
had insisted on taking both. Some girls were
stranded at Fortress Monroe, two or three of
whom I succeeded in sending home safely. Three
others, stranded and penniless, fell under the protection
(?) of young officers. I then resigned my
secretaryship of the Masonic Mission, with a
threat to expose and have them arrested for false
pretenses, but they disappeared in a night, and
were never more heard of.</p>

<p>On the return of Miss Hancock to the second
corps’ kitchen, some red tape became tangled up,
and, as I was invited to assist in the New Jersey
and Pennsylvania Agency with Doctor Hettie K.
Painter, I gladly accepted, and worked for the men
of those states, though, each of the Agencies desiring
my help, we all worked in the same spirit for
all the “Boys.”</p>

<p>A most interesting Pennsylvania case was that
of a young captain who had received a thigh
fracture while at the front at Petersburg. The
leg had to be amputated so high that the artery
could not be taken up, and it was impossible to
close it in the usual manner. Consequently men
were detailed to hold or press their thumbs ceaselessly
upon the open artery, each man serving four
hours at a time, although another was always
ready to take his place in case the strain of holding
so long in a cramped position should cause him to
relax or faint. This was continued for weeks till
the artery actually healed. I believe only one
other such case occurred during the Civil war.
While hastily passing through his ward one day,
Lieutenant Stanwood called my attention to this
officer.</p>

<p>Contrary to my intention of caring only for
young boys, I felt it my duty to do what I could
for this sufferer, whom I found in a very critical
state, needing the utmost care to bring him
through. Being a blonde, he was transparently
white from loss of blood, and so weak that he
scarcely tried to live. He had no interest in anything
and no appetite. There was no time to be
lost here, so I said—&#8203;“Captain, you do not eat, I
hear, and I want to make you something that you
would like.”</p>

<p>“I have no appetite,” he replied feebly.</p>

<p>“Can you think of something you could relish?”</p>

<p>After a pause he said, “I think it’s hardly worth
your time. I shall not recover, but perhaps I could
eat some barley broth if it is possible to get it.”</p>

<p>Always strong on the optimistic side, I
answered, “I think we can find some, Captain.”</p>

<p>But where? Perhaps not nearer than Washington
and forty or more hours away. Here was possibly
a life to save. Beginning at the Sanitary
Commission, at the head of the agency row, I went
to each State agency in a faint hope of at least
securing some substitute, but nothing could I find.
Barley was such a simple thing; and now might
save a life! I racked my brain to find some palatable
substitute. As a last hope I went to the
Christian Commission with my anxious inquiry,
“Can’t you remember if on your list of supplies
some thoughtful man or woman has sent this now
invaluable donation?”</p>

<p>Mr. Houghten said, “I seem to remember that
about six months ago there was sent a little package
marked barley, but how can we find it in this
great store of supplies?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I exclaimed, “put on all your men to
hunt for it; it may save a life worth saving.”</p>

<p>To my delight, after a long search, a package of
about four by three inches was discovered. Losing
no time, I ran to my tent and started a few
spoonfuls boiling. The surgeon had said not even
salt could be allowed the patient, lest it should
increase circulation and thus break open the artery
scarcely healed.</p>

<p>At last with my special attractive little array of
silver cup, dainty doiley, etc., I went to the poor
captain. His refined face at once showed his appreciation
of the neat service.</p>

<p>“Here’s your barley, Captain,” I said cheeringly;
“let me feed you a few spoonfuls now, and
I’ll come back and give you a little more bye and
bye. And, Captain, I shall leave it all here on this
little table; don’t let any one carry it off.”</p>

<p>The poor, feeble cripple, who had not been allowed
to change his position for many days, said—&#8203;“They’d
better not touch it!” and he fixed his
great blue eyes on the tray with an air of defiance,
pathetic to see. So his mind had something to
guard, and this somewhat diverted his attention
from the dying and suffering men about him.
Next day the surgeon allowed a little salt, then a
little butter, and at last a little meat. By this time
his digestion would allow stronger food, and this
was fortunate, for, though I had guarded every
grain of the precious little package, it was almost
exhausted.</p>

<p>I have often pictured to myself a kindly, country
old lady in white cap and kerchief, whose
prescience in sending this precious barley probably
saved a life, and I wished that she could know it.</p>

<p>The captain lived, and went to Washington quite
recovered, where he received a government leg
(gratis) which fitted so well that he could jump off
a moving car. He then went home quite well,
having sacrificed a leg to his country. His temperate
clean manner of living served him in an
emergency and carried him over the crisis.</p>

<p>The mistaken idea of so many men, especially
military men of that time, that liquor gives
strength and courage, cost many an otherwise pure
character his life in such an exigency.</p>

<p>By contrast with the above I will cite the case
of Colonel Murphy, Sixty-ninth New York Infantry,
second corps, a brave officer, worshipped
by his men. He was a man of fine physique and
robust appearance when I saw him, despite his
fatal wound, a fracture of the thigh, similar to that
of the Pennsylvania captain. To perform the
amputation and carry him over successfully it was
necessary to stimulate him and this was impossible,
his body being already over-stimulated by the
drinking habit to the last degree. I never before
begrudged anything to a wounded man, but I knew
that my choice brandy could not help him. He
died without even a chance of being saved,
mourned and regretted by his whole corps.

<h3>AN UNEXPECTED RIDE</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> a beautiful clear night, while still in the
Corps d’Afric, a party of ladies and officers
walked a short distance to a cabin where a
negro preacher drew a large crowd. This man,
though uneducated, was a wonder of natural oratory
and eloquence. In addressing his admiring
audience his vocabulary was remarkable, as he used
some extraordinary sentences such as—&#8203;“All the
englomerated hosts of heaven.”</p>

<p>While at this meeting an orderly came for me
saying that a couple of officers from the front desired
to see me at my tent. I found there two
uniformed, mounted officers awaiting me, one of
whom proved to be my old friend Captain Frank
Dexter of the Engineer Corps.</p>

<p>The night was perfect in a mild atmosphere and
a full orbed moon, and I was reminded of James’
old time “Solitary Horseman,” though here were
<em>two</em> rarely handsome men of fine physique; and as
they stood, holding their fiery steeds, they formed
a romantic picture.</p>

<p>After a pleasant talk of home and friends they
remounted, and with raised sombreros, their
spurred horses dashed away to the clinking of
sword and hoofs, while the bright moon rays
glinted uniforms and accoutrements, till they
passed under the shadow of the distant woods.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_132.jpg"
 alt="Captain Dexter">
 <p class="caption">CAPTAIN B. F. DEXTER</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Captain Dexter had raised Company L of the
Fiftieth Volunteer Engineer Corps early in the
war, and still commanded that company at Petersburg
front, and during many battles. After the
close of the war, he became a successful physician,
and in addition to his practice in New York City
he held for many years the position of Police
Surgeon.</p>

<p>As some patients needed fresh milk, I started out
boldly one afternoon, with an orderly carrying an
empty pail and a basket of extracts and small supplies.
We rode through the woods beyond our
lines to a secesh house quite near. On the piazza
were a pretty young girl and a young Confederate
officer in full grey uniform. With them were two
or three ladies. At first they were suspicious lest
it was a ruse on our part to capture the young
“reb,” but a pleasant talk followed, and they
were glad to exchange some quarts of milk for the
small luxuries that they had been so long unable
to secure, and to arrange an exchange of milk for
such articles in the future.</p>

<p>We gave the sick rebel prisoners the same attention
as our own boys. One asked why we were so
kind to them, and I replied—&#8203;“Why, don’t you
know we’re feeding you up to make you well and
then send you back so we can fight you over
again.” This greatly amused them.</p>

<p>A rumor spread through the camp that the rebel
gunboats were coming down the James to capture
the hospital. Much excitement followed as to
what we women would do; should we try to escape
or should we remain with the sick? We
promptly decided to remain with our boys; but
happily the gunboats did not come.</p>

<p>My only recreation was an occasional horseback
ride, accompanied by a mounted orderly. As
there was only one lady’s saddle in camp, it was
difficult to secure it. Two or three high cavalry
saddles were altered so that women could ride, uncomfortably,
on them. I once rode a horse from
General Russell’s headquarters at the Point, and
found the animal quite unmanageable. He at once
started for a run and it was impossible to check
or hold him. I barely managed to hold on, winding
the reins about my hands, and bracing myself
in the too small saddle. We passed a hotel on the
road where many officers were sitting, then General
Grant’s tent, and then dashed down the road
over a pile of logs, nearly upsetting some soldiers
at work there. With a sudden stop that nearly
sent me over the horse’s head the animal stood
quietly in front of General Russell’s open office
window, where the General and his staff were consulting.
They sprang up at the clatter and, gasping
for breath, I said, “General, I didn’t come to
see you because I wanted to, but because I couldn’t
help it.” And there was a general laugh. The
check rein had been forgotten.</p>

<p>Another horse took me back very quietly, but
for many days the strained muscles stood out like
those of an athlete, and there was pain enough
through my entire body to make me sympathize
with a chronic “rheumatic.”</p>

<p>We sometimes rode to U. S. Headquarters to
see the drill and inspection of General Russell’s
colored brigade. General Grant often stood beside
his magnificent black horse at these inspections,
and was very proud of the perfect drill of
the negro infantry, whom he complimented, to
their great happiness. These were the first colored
troops I had seen.</p>

<p>According to General Butler’s autobiography
“The first regiment of colored soldiers was
mustered in at New Orleans on August <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr>, 1862.
Better soldiers never shouldered a musket. They
learned to handle arms and to march more readily
than white men.”</p>

<p>How little thought and justice has been given to
the fact that, when enlistments began, and as the
demand for Confederate troops became more imperative,
even old men and boys were drafted into
the Southern army,—&#8203;for light duty perhaps. In
some cases there was not a white man within many
miles, and to the care and honor of these negroes,
plantations of hundreds of acres were left that
they might continue to raise food and supplies for
their army. Despite the fact that thousands of
these negroes had practically no restraint to fear,
they cheerfully labored against a cause that even
at that early day they felt was for their emancipation,
and yet I never heard of an uprising that
could not have been checked by helpless women.
There was not a case of robbery, destruction of
property or rapine among the faithful workers who
became the protectors of Southern women and
children.</p>

<p>In a sketch of the life of General Charles Halpin,
(Private Miles O’Reilly) occur the following
verses. “Sambo’s Right to Get Kilt” was written
to accustom the Northern soldiers to the presence
of the negro. They had so strong a prejudice
against the negro that they did not like him
even to be killed in the company of white soldiers.
Its effect was astonishing and its argument was
unanswerable, and negro soldiers were ever after
held in the respect due to their orderly conduct.
General Butler considered them a necessity of
Northern success, mainly due to the wonderfully
skilled pen of General Halpin, who died at the
early age of thirty-seven, at the height of literary
honor.</p>

<h3>TWO FIANCÉES</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> were all much interested in the case of
a young lieutenant who had lost a leg and
was slowly recovering. He had written
to his fiancée that he was disabled, and would give
her up if she so desired. He was now awaiting
anxiously her reply.</p>

<p>Quite coincidently, at the other end of the ward
was Major Hemlock, of the Forty-seventh New
York Infantry, who had lost a leg and he, too, had
written his fiancée offering to release her from her
promise. As time went by without bringing a
reply the lieutenant became very despondent.
One day in passing I saw an unopened letter lying
upon his breast and exclaimed: “Oh, lieutenant,
your letter has come after all; but it is not opened!
Shall I open it for you?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered in a despairing voice. “I
know what it says.”</p>

<p>Unable to persuade him to read his letter, and
feeling quite sure that it must be favorable, I ran
quickly to Mrs. Mayhew, of his State agency,
telling her of the letter. She went at once to him,
and in her sweet sisterly way at last induced him
to consent to open the letter. His intuitions
proved only too true. “Perhaps,” the girl had
written, “it would be best; we could still be
friends.”</p>

<p>Our indignation knew no bounds. The poor
fellow sank rapidly and died a few days later of a
broken heart. He was carried by his comrades,
led by the funeral march of the shrill fife and the
drum, to his soldier’s grave in the woods, over
which they fired the farewell salute.</p>

<p>During this time I was greatly surprised one
day on visiting this ward to find Major Hemlock
dressed and sitting up, looking happy and like another
man. After a second glance I saw the cause
of this change, for beside him sat a charming
young girl who, in reply to his letter offering her
a release, had started at once and succeeded in
reaching him safely. The Major was soon able
to travel and the happy pair returned to their home
in Philadelphia where they were married.</p>

<p>My friend Mary Blackmar, a medical student,
enlisted as nurse, that she might serve her year in
the field work with its wider experience, instead of
in some regular city hospital. A year after the
war she graduated from the Woman’s Medical
College, in Philadelphia, and assisted for a year in
the dispensary with those wonderful pioneer
women doctors Mary and Elizabeth Blackwell, in
New York City. Miss Blackmar married, and
finally, owing to ill health, was obliged to live in
Florida, where she still practises medicine as Doctor
Mary Blackmar Bruson.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1909 I found a little notice in
the newspaper stating that Doctor Elizabeth
Blackwell was still living near London at ninety
years of age. About the same time I met a gentleman
of my native city whose father (this name has
escaped me) was the first reputable doctor to hold
consultation with these remarkable women. This
required courage, for at that time women doctors
were considered bold intruders, “unsexed”—&#8203;whatever
that may mean—&#8203;and why? Because
they thought that it was time for women to know
something about their own bodies and diseases.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_141.jpg"
 alt="MARY BLACKMAR">
 <p class="caption">MARY BLACKMAR</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>One morning Miss Blackmar, quite excited, her
dark eyes dancing with pleasure, ran into my tent
exclaiming, “O, Colonel” (meaning me) “such a
beautiful girl is in camp, you must see her! I
don’t know how she got here; but I can’t stop a
moment, I must run back to my patients.”</p>

<p>Soon after, a graceful blonde was sent to us from
headquarters to be entertained. She stated that,
though English, she was in Edinboro when the
news reached her that her brother was wounded
at City Point, and she lost no time in sailing on
the first vessel to America, where, perhaps owing
to her good looks and persistence she succeeded in
reaching our hospital. Meanwhile the brother
had returned to his regiment, the Thirty-seventh
Wisconsin, before Petersburg. I found means,
however, to communicate with him, and in a few
hours he pulled rein at our tent, having ridden
many miles without a halt.</p>

<p>It soon developed that he was something more
than a brother; though the girl claimed that this
dashing, handsome young Englishman, Captain
Robert Eden, was an adopted brother. He often
got leave of absence that he might spend an hour
with his fiancée, Miss Annie Bain, who became
our friend and companion and, though taking no
part in our work, remained with us during some
months.</p>

<p>About this time our hospitality was taxed still
further. An orderly brought a pleasant-looking
woman and presented a note from Hospital Headquarters
which read—&#8203;“Please entertain Miss
Mason, who is on her way South by ‘flag of
truce’…. She is secesh. Watch her.”</p>

<p>Miss Mason remained a few days, and went
South by first detachment of paroled rebel patients
without any incident of interest.

<h3>THE STORY OF MY PASS</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> were often annoyed by the calls of
officers who, having little to occupy their
time, could not understand how it was
possible for us to be too tired to entertain them.
They frequently called on me when I had many
letters to write, and I would say to them: “Well,
gentlemen, if it’s any satisfaction to you to sit here
while I write letters, I’ve no objection, but these
home letters for the Boys are my first duty.”
They thought I should feel complimented by the
calls of headquarters’ officers, but I assured them I
was quite aware that they had come to me only to
kill time, when they had exhausted all other
amusements.</p>

<p>It was really too much honor, and too much of
a good thing when forty-five officers called on me
in one week, some coming in from the front on
short leave when all was quiet on the James, others
from Grant’s Headquarters, and from our Hospital
Headquarters.</p>

<p>One evening I was very tired and three of these
officers, fine looking men in full uniform, but
slightly under the influence of liquor, annoyed me
greatly. At “taps” I said significantly—&#8203;“It’s
taps, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>“That does not concern us,” one replied, “we
can stay as long as we wish.”
</p>

<p>“General Grant himself could not stay in my
tent after taps,” I retorted indignantly.</p>

<p>They made no move to go, however. I arose
and simply pointed to the tent opening, declining
any reply to their remarks. They at last passed
out in great indignation, and immediately one of
these doctors began a petty persecution. Knowing
that I had lost my pass he tried to have me
sent to Washington. This soon became known in
camp, and my friends set themselves to work to
circumvent his unmanly spite.</p>

<p>He obtained an order from the Provost Marshall,
General Patrick, by which all persons in
camp not having passes should report at once to
Washington. It was necessary, however, that he
should notify personally any one so unfortunate as
to have no pass. When he called at my tent I
was never to be found, for whenever the doctor
approached some one would say “Here comes C!”
and I began a system of remarkable evolutions
from one tent to another in the row, gliding back
and forth, until he had to give up the search for
the day.</p>

<p>Fortunately my good friend, Mrs. Doctor
Painter, had made such a favorable report of me
to General Grant’s Headquarters that a pass was
promised. The utmost diplomacy was necessary
to gain time, but at last the pass was handed to
me, secretly, on Thanksgiving eve, as we were
decorating the mess hall for the coming feast.</p>

<p>The next day I was at home when Doctor C.
called. I received him with much courtesy and
said: “I hear, doctor, that you have called several
times when I was not in. To what am I indebted
for so much attention? Be seated.”</p>

<p>The florid face grew redder, but I gave him no
chance to speak, and in my most agreeable manner
I talked and talked of everything I could think of,
despite his many efforts to get in a word. Finally
I grew tired of the fun, as were also some friends
and listeners in the adjoining tent. Then, as if
just remembering his attempts to speak, I said,
“O, doctor, had you something to say to me?”</p>

<p>Growing still redder, if possible, and sitting uncomfortably
on the edge of the barrel chair that I
had insisted on his taking, he said, “O, only that
an order is received that all persons not having
authority must report to Washington. <span class="lock">Er—</span> er—&#8203;have
you a pass?”</p>

<p>“Doctor, you know that my pass was stolen.”
And I asked demurely what I should do.</p>

<p>With an air of exultation he sprang up and said—&#8203;“Unfortunately,
Miss Smith, you will have to
report to Washington to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Then slowly taking the pass from my pocket, I
said hesitatingly, “Well, Doctor, here is a paper
that perhaps will help me,” and I handed him the
Grant pass.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r2">
“Headquarters Armies United States,<br>
City Point, Virginia, March 16, 1865.<br>
</p>

<p>Miss Smith will be afforded all facilities that Army
Commanders afford to other State Agents.</p>

<p>Free transportation will be given her on all Government
steamers and Military Railroads. Guards and
pickets will pass her accordingly.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>I watched him in silence till he finished reading.
His face was crimson and he said with a nervous
giggle, “O, yes, er—&#8203;I’ll fix you up at medical
headquarters all right!”</p>

<p>“Will you, indeed?” I replied, “I think I have
fixed you. Now you may go,” and he lost no
time in going.</p>

<p>The laughter in the next tent must have reached
him as he darted out and across the road to the
hospital headquarters, where he exclaimed breathlessly:
<span class="lock">“D——</span> that Miss Smith. When I thought
I had her all right she kept me on nettles for an
hour, and then showed me an order from General
Grant ranking me.”</p>

<p>This soon became camp gossip, and he was
jeered from one side to the other of the hospital.

<h3>THANKSGIVING, 1864</h3>

<p class="center">UNDER FIRE AT DUTCH GAP, VIRGINIA</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Greatly</span> needing a day’s rest from hospital
work, I ordered an ambulance, good
government horses and driver, and invited
my guest, Miss Bain, and two reliable officers of
the Corps d’ Afric, stationed at General Grant’s
headquarters, City Point, to accompany us, and
accept an invitation to dinner.</p>

<p>We started for the renowned “Dutch Gap,”
which had been excavated under the supervision of
General Benjamin Butler, then in command of the
Army of the James, and it was intended to compel
the enemy to make a complete change of base.</p>

<p>A ride of seven or eight miles, through woods
and over bumping corduroy roads and ditches,
brought us to the James River, where we had been
invited to a Thanksgiving dinner of goose (save
the mark) on a commissary barge then anchored
opposite the Gap. To my annoyance and Miss
Bain’s consternation, as she was interested only in
Captain Eden, then at the front, we found ten or
twelve officers in full dress waiting to receive us
formally on the barge, when we arrived. It took
a great deal of courage and not a little tact to get
through that dinner creditably, while every man
craved special attention.
</p>

<p>After dinner we rowed on the narrow river to
the monitor Onondaga and another war vessel
near by. On board the Onondaga we encountered
another crowd of naval officers, and were urgently
invited to inspect these wonderfully constructed
vessels which were stationed here to protect the
Gap, and to prevent the rebel gunboats coming
down the river.</p>

<p>We landed near this great excavation called
“Dutch Gap,” which was to be Butler’s chef
d’œuvre, viz., a channel cut across a long peninsula
dividing the river at the end into two branches
running almost parallel; in front of which the
formidable Confederate mortars were continually
sending shells all about this locality. A shell had
dropped directly into the dredging machine, shattering
it completely and it now lay on one side like
a huge black mastodon. The channel lacked about
twenty-five feet of successful completion, but owing
to “orders” no further work was accomplished,
and thus ended the great Dutch Gap strategy of
Ben Butler.</p>

<p>The small row boat landed us on the muddy
shore where little foliage remained to cover the
denuded ground of the rough camp of an engineering
corps and its guard. Despite the almost constant
war courtesy of interchanging shots and
shells, roaring on either side from the forts, and
generally passing safely above the heads of
“Yank” and “Johnnie” alike on each side of the
river, they enjoyed many friendly talks across.
Thus they broke the monotony of picket duty and
gopher holes, while telling camp stories, true or
otherwise, as the occasion suggested.</p>

<p>A story was told me that bears out on its face
the imprint of possibility during the last days of the
rebellion. A daring young “Reb,” tired of life
in the swamp and woods, with insufficient rations,
while waiting for orders to advance, one dark
night swam boldly across the narrow stream and
was cordially received.</p>

<p>After enjoying a jolly evening around the camp
fire, and especially, a good “square meal,” he said
to the Yankee boys, “You uns have plenty of good
grub any way, and I’m about starved out. I say,
Yanks, suppose you uns just surround me and capture
me and march me up to headquarters as a
deserter? I’d rather stay on this side and have
good rations than to starve in the swamp on the
other side.”</p>

<p>This the “Yanks” did very cheerfully, and so
another deserter was added to the Union army.</p>

<p>Our party started to walk around what was to
have been Ferry Island, where the tortuous river
made a sharp turn at the end, almost doubling on
itself. An officer walking with me constantly
changed from one side to the other. This surprised
me and on my asking why he did this he
replied “O nothing!” ignoring the question,
though he continued changing sides as we walked
on the uneven path. I insisted at last upon an
explanation. He replied: “Well, you know the
rebs are just across this narrow water in the
woods, and it wouldn’t look well if a lady should
get a stray shot!”</p>

<p>“So you’re making a target of yourself, Major,
to gratify my curiosity!” I was insisting on
going back, when a “Johnny Reb” called across
the stream in a pleasant tone, “Better take those
ladies away!”</p>

<p>Mounting the great hill to look into the abandoned
ditch where so much time and labor had been
lost, we made a strikingly conspicuous group with
the officers in uniforms,
bright with
the sun’s reflections.
Suddenly
in the midst of
witty talk and
badinage a shell
from the Rebel
mortar shrieked
over our heads,
followed quickly
by a second one
with a deafening
frightful explosion,
and for a second
we were
stunned and almost
paralyzed.</p>

 <p class="center">(By kind permission of Harper’s Weekly: Appeared <abbr title="February">Febr.</abbr> 5, 1864.)</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>But not a moment
was lost.
An officer on
either side
grabbed the hands
of Miss Bain and
myself and “sans
ceremonie,” ran
us quickly down
the hill until we
were safe in a
large bomb-proof
gopher hole, where we stopped for breath. These
gallant officers carried a quantity of “Sacred Soil”
on their spotless white trousers and polished boots.
Here we waited while the shells continued to fall
at some distance.</p>

<p>A large hole had been dug in the side of the hill
where a plank floor and roof had been made to
prevent falling in. This served as a mess room,
while around the side of the high bluff, in small
gopher holes, men hived like ants in their earth
hills.</p>

<p>Hospitality suggested that a supper be prepared
for us, and it was spread on planks with newspaper
tablecloth, tin cups and plates, and two-tined
forks. An old aunty cook waited on us, and
served some rather weighty biscuit. The “pièce
de résistance” at this supper and also at the barge
dinner, was a rather opaque tumbler filled with
peppermint sticks, which had been procured from
the sutler.</p>

<p>The firing continued, and shells struck the water
in the only channel by which we could return.
Night was coming on, and I was at a loss to know
what to do. Not wishing to alarm Miss Bain, I
took an officer aside and consulted him.</p>

<p>They would do the best they could for us with
only gophers for shelter, if we wished to pass the
night there. If we attempted to cross the river it
must be at our own risk, as the firing would probably
continue until nightfall.</p>

<p>I decided at once for myself, but Miss Bain was
my guest and must be given a choice. The
agency people had always been careful to avoid
even an appearance of evil. “Should we brave
the comment of staying all night in a strange
camp, or must we risk our lives in attempting to
escape the shells falling on our route?” Without
a moment’s hesitation the courageous girl said
firmly and briefly, “I’d rather risk the shells and
drowning.”</p>

<p>A boat was ordered at a pistol’s point, and the
poor pallid rower was so frightened that he could
scarcely hold the oars. We got in with only our
two escorts; the others were evidently not at all
eager to accompany us back, but stood behind the
hill anxiously watching our dangerous passage.</p>

<p>As we passed close by the Onondaga and her
companion nothing living could be seen on these
fully manned monitors. They had closed down
their steel decks while the shells struck, ricocheted
and fell harmlessly into the water like great
marbles, as we passed by. A few feet farther on
was the barge where we had dined with our military
escort and where busy hands had helped us
into the boat. It was now as deserted as if never
occupied, the men had fled for safety to the woods.
As we neared the muddy bank one shell struck a
few feet astern of our boat, sending up a column
of water like a geyser; another passed close overhead
with its uncanny blood-curdling shriek, and
struck the shore just ahead of us, where it exploded,
driving pieces of shell and mud in every
direction.</p>

<p>On reaching the mud shore, it was almost impossible
to mount the rough improvised dock or
float. However, our escorts pushed and we
climbed up, with no formalities, and without loss
of time. At first I could not see my ambulance,
but soon it came out of the woods with the
frightened horses dashing down the hill. The
driver as he turned, shouted, “I can’t stop, you
must get in somehow!” Certainly it was “somehow”
that our officers tumbled us into the rocking
ambulance as it turned and dashed wildly back into
the woods.</p>

<p>No word was spoken until the driver checked
his mad race and we were out of range of the still
falling shells, and could congratulate ourselves on
our narrow escape. We reached camp at twilight,
a little excited by our adventure, but quite
the heroes of the day; and we resolved that it
would be a long time before we again wandered
out of camp.</p>

<p>Since writing the above experience I have found
in General Butler’s autobiography, the only historical
statement of that strategical attempt on the
James River, and it confirms my memory. This
work was considered of the greatest military importance
then, and if accomplished as designed, it
would, without doubt, have given to our navy and
land forces the control of the river almost directly
in front of Richmond. This would have shortened
by several months the acute warfare by which
hundreds of lives were sacrificed.</p>

<p>That it failed when all was prepared to blow out
the bulk head, and admit our monitors through
the canal, was due to the fact that the original
Commander (Smith) was ordered elsewhere, and
that the new Commander begged Commodore
Ludlow not to open Dutch Gap because he feared
that the enemies’ fleet would come down, and he
did not know that he could sustain the attack, etc.
This Commander was dismissed for cowardice
later, when he took fright while the enemies’ fleet
attempted to come down the river, and, without
any attempt at defense, ordered the Potomac to
make all speed, and only stopped when he knew
that an accident to the Confederate vessels had
prevented an assault on the United States Headquarters
at City Point, which might have destroyed
the camp and involved an entire change of
base.</p>

<p>That one finds little allusion to this engineering
attempt is doubtless due to the fact that most
histories of that time were written by West Point
officers, who gave few details outside their own
personal experiences; and regard for the gallant
volunteer service was seldom admitted and too
often entirely ignored.</p>

<p>General Butler often fell under this ban, and he
lost no opportunity, when possible, of publicly
showing the superior education in tactics of the
volunteer officers and men under his command
during the war.</p>

<p>In this personal sketch I do not attempt to write
history; but give only a few selections regarding
the expectations then known to many in that locality
of the James River. I have given only a few
selections from “Butler.” These any one may
verify, and in doing so will come across many other
details of interest.</p>

<p>“Captain Melantha Smith, of the navy, assured
me that it was impossible for his monitors, drawing
sixteen feet of water, to get up further than
Trent’s Reach. We made a reconnaissance to devise
a plan by which he might ascend the James
with his vessels, then lying at a point called Dutch
Gap.</p>

<p>“Here is a peculiar formation, the river running
up by Trent’s Reach, bends very sharply to the
right and returns again, in an elongated horseshoe,
so directly that while it has passed over a distance
of over seven miles, the waters of the river at a
depth of twenty-five feet, approach so nearly, that
there is only about four hundred and twenty-five
feet from the water on the other side across the
neck at Dutch Gap to twenty-five feet of water on
the lower side, so a canal wide and deep enough for
our gunboats to get through, would require a cut
less than four hundred feet long, sixteen feet deep,
sixty feet wide at the bottom and ninety feet at the
top.</p>

<p>“After having made a reconnaissance with Captain
Smith, then in command of the naval forces of
the James River, I went down to City Point and
asked General Grant and Chief Engineer Barnard
to come up with us to examine the premises. This
they did and made a careful examination of the
point. This was known as Dutch Gap for the reason
that some enterprising German had cut quite a
gap in undertaking to build a waterway through,
many years before. We came to the conclusion
that it was a desirable thing to do, and General
Grant directed me to undertake it.</p>

<p>“Exploration proved it to be of very hard limestone
and gravel; in it was imbedded petrified
wood, whole trees being turned into a very friable
stone, easily broken.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>“The enemy, appreciating the importance of this
strategic undertaking, and finding that we could not
be reached by direct fire of their artillery, erected
some mortar batteries on the other side of the
James River. At a mile and a half distance it is
not easy to drop a shell with any certainty into a
space three hundred feet long by ninety feet wide.</p>

<p>“The first thing to do was to station a couple of
well instructed men at points from which every
shell could be watched during its wild flight. These
observers after a little practice could tell almost
precisely where the missile would land—&#8203;whether
it would come into our excavation. While the
men were at work, these men were on the watch,
and if a shell was likely to fall in our way, the
watchmen would call out “Holes,” whereupon the
men would rush into the bomb-proofs, and come
out again and resume work as soon as the shell
had struck or exploded without harm.”</p>

<p>Dutch Gap has since been dredged out and is a
main channel for commerce between Richmond and
the outer world. The waters of the James River
being directed by the canal, no longer flow around
through any depth at Trench Reach, and that
which was the former channel of the river will soon
become marsh land. Dutch Gap is the only military
construction of all that was done by our army,
which remains of use to the country in time of
peace;—&#8203;a monument to its projector and constructor,—&#8203;one
of “Butler’s failures.”</p>

<p>My army friend of 1864, Mr. J. Yates Peek and
his wife, within a few years, have sailed through
Butler’s Gap, remembering the days of its intended
strategy and the great disappointment when the
navy caused its failure.</p>

<h3>DOMESTIC LIFE IN CAMP AND OTHER INCIDENTS</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> Pennsylvania and New Jersey State quarters
combined, we had three good-sized connecting
tents; and later the little New York house was
added.</p>

<p>Our kitchen was generally run by Hannah, a
rather incompetent contraband, with great wondering
eyes and slipshod feet. There were many
such about camp, girls and women as well as men
and boys—&#8203;anxious to work for shelter and food,
but without knowledge of the value of money,
which they generally squandered at the sutler’s for
some trifle such as candy, or something to eat.
Sufficient for the day was their evil tempter.</p>

<p>A good cooking stove was a great comfort, and
Doctor Painter, an excellent cook, made our mess
appetizing. The agents were expected to get their
sustenance from State supplies, and we could buy
from the Commissary Department good bread and
coffee. Our table was made of boards resting on
barrels, and sometimes we were quite stylish, having
a white tablecloth instead of newspapers. Our
dishes, mostly of tin, served quite well for hungry,
hurried appetites.</p>

<p>Our reception tent, which was the largest, had at
first a bunk in one corner where the rain sometimes
percolated through the canvas walls, and one morning,—&#8203;my
pillow touching the wet wall of the tent,—&#8203;I
found my head in a little puddle of water. But
I was in better health, if possible, than before. We
laughed at these happenings, also when the rain
ran in streams over our ground floor and at night
we were obliged to sit resting, or writing by the
light of candles stuck in bottles, with our feet on
logs to keep them dry. Meanwhile a log fire
burned cheerfully in the rough mud and log chimney.
A barrel was placed on top for draught. It
sometimes caught fire, but some one always managed
to discover it, and knocked it off without setting
fire to the canvas roofs. Our barrel chairs
were not luxurious, but, like everything in camp,
they served their purpose.</p>

<p>Though our tents were not transparent, the candle
distinctly silhouetted our forms on the walls as
we sat talking with friends, so that passers could
recognize visitors and perhaps wait for a more
favorable time to call. During the day our tent
flaps were always open hospitably. Agents and
officers often visited and talked of home, friends,
comforts, etc., while each was always ready to assist
in an emergency. Convalescents often got
leave to come for some luxury or necessity; they
craved fruit and vegetables, especially onions, and
one so craved this luxury that he offered me fifty
cents for one. Of course it became a gift, and one
that was greatly enjoyed.</p>

<p>The wife of the Ohio agent, a pretty brunette
with long black curls and black eyes, became very
ill. Their small tents were not comfortable. All
the ladies helped in many ways to make her limitations
less trying. We were fearful of a sad ending
as she lay helplessly weak for many days, but youth
and courage, with good care, at last put her upon
her feet again quite well.</p>

<p>An extremely annoying encounter occurred while
I was with Mrs. Painter in my little house attached
to another tent. One evening, with considerable
clatter, an officer, followed by his orderly, halted
at my door and knocked for admission. I saw at
once that this otherwise fine young man, from
Brooklyn, was under the influence of liquor. There
was no escape and I must, if possible, get along
peaceably with him.</p>

<p>My friends in the next tent could hear every
word and could have helped me to get rid of him,
but they thought it a good joke to get me cornered,
while they laughed and quietly enjoyed the interview.</p>

<p>“Miss Smith,” mumbled the visitor, “I’m so
glad to see you. I told the fer-rers I’d give fifty
dollars for an introduction to you, when I saw you
on the ch-cha-chapel platform singing just as if you
didn’t care fu-fur any body.”</p>

<p>I could think of no plan to get rid of him, and still
hoped my friends would come to my rescue.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Smith,” he went on, “I wish I had a
ba-ba-badge like yours. Couldn’t you give it to
me?”

<p>Thinking to escape his effusions and to hasten
his exit, I took off my precious Lincoln mourning
badge and handed it to him. But he grew more
persistent, saying:</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you just pin-pin it on?”</p>

<p>In silent indignation and protest I did so, to his
great satisfaction. Then as his speech grew more
indistinct, he added: “W-w-when I tell the ferrers
that M-Miss Smith put-put that on, they’ll all
be ravin’ jealous!”</p>

<p>I do not remember how at last I got him out of
the little house. I saw his orderly help him to
mount a superb horse that had impatiently pawed
the ground since he entered.</p>

<p>My indignation passed for little above the shouts
of laughter at my discomfiture that for once I was
caught in a dilemma.</p>

<p>But this recalcitrant young officer received a
startling communication on the following day
which, doubtless, caused a permanent revulsion of
admiration.</p>

<p>The wife of an officer, with her four year old
girl, was very anxious to join her husband at the
front. Knowing that I held a pass, she persuaded
me to take her to the camp, which might have made
me considerable trouble, as she could not get permission
from Headquarters. Being willing to help
her, if possible, I sent for an ambulance and driver,
and we started over the corduroy roads, ditches,
ruts and mud,—&#8203;a foot deep in some places,—&#8203;occasionally
in danger of being overturned, as we
rode at times partly on one wheel or two, rarely on
four. In a sudden lurch this mother so lost her
head with fright that she raised her feet and shot
out on one side into the “Sacred Soil” of Virginia,
quite up to her knees. I grasped the child and
flung myself with her on the opposite side, thus
righting the ambulance, and feeling little sympathy
for the mother who forgot her child, though her
feet were completely covered with mud. We
found her husband in camp, and I left them quite
happy in their tent before Petersburg.</p>

<p>One of our surgeons owned a superb black horse
that was so intelligent, one could not pass him without
petting him. This he greatly enjoyed, and he
showed that he remembered me. His handsome
owner remarked, “I’m soon going to take you for
a ride on him.”</p>

<p>“O, you are, indeed. I believe it takes two to
make an engagement, and I have reasons for not
wishing to ride with you,” I replied. “Good
morning!” and so I left him greatly incensed.</p>

<p>Officers were constantly riding about our camp,
and among them was Doctor Weir Mitchell of the
cavalry, now the distinguished nerve specialist of
Philadelphia, and author of many scientific works
as well as novels. He often dashed down our row
on a spirited horse, his long hair floating back,
while his yellow-lined cape, thrown over his shoulder,
made him a conspicuous figure.</p>

<p>Doctor Olmstead, of the 69th Regiment, a
Brooklyn man, had received a wound in his foot
from a spent ball, and for some time limped quite
comfortably about camp. We much enjoyed his
occasional calls and his kindly courtesy. I wear,
on occasion, a silver trefoil of the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> Division, <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>
Corps, to which he belonged, made from a silver
quarter (scarce in those days) and urged upon me
by a grateful boy patient. Doctor Olmstead was
kind enough to send it to Washington and have it
made. It is now a much valued relic.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, 1864, Mrs. Painter, wishing
to make a pleasant surprise with home-made cheer
for her son, Hettie K. Painter, who was still in
charge of the telegraph at Hatch’s Run, again invited
me to accompany her.</p>

<p>After the usual bumping over corduroy and other
bad roads near the point, we found him in his little
improvised office and living room. Doctor Painter
with the assistance of a cheerful contraband helper
soon prepared a surprisingly comfortable Christmas
dinner, which was greatly enjoyed by our little
party.</p>

<p>During this homely visit, Hettie Painter remarked
to me, “Miss Smith you are always looking
up some souvenir of the war, here is something
that you may appreciate. This is a telegram from
General Sherman, received here this morning en
route, and I immediately forwarded a copy to President
Lincoln in Washington. It is therefore a
copy of the message before it was despatched to
the President.”</p>

<p>Much pleased with this souvenir, now a relic of
that wonderful conquest, I have preserved it carefully.
Some months since I presented it to the
U. S. Grant Post of Brooklyn, and by them it was
neatly framed and is now in the fine military museum
of that post’s relics. The following is a verbatim
copy:</p>

<h3>LOVE IN CAMP</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Miss Annie Bain</span> was still with us, and
had become my friend, and my companion,
when time permitted. She made a restful
change in the monotony of daily incessant hard
work when, except for letter writing or in some
extreme case when a dying soldier called us out,
we remained during the evening in our tents.</p>

<p>Impossible as it seemed for a woman without
pass or authority, Miss Bain succeeded, with little
difficulty, in reaching City Point. A little tearful
entreaty from a beautiful young woman has often
moved the heart of the strictest disciplinarian.
Upon reporting at City Point to that ogre of the
department to all stragglers and irregulars, General
Patrick, he gave her protection and permission to
remain until her brother should receive his furlough.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Captain Robert Eden, of the 37th
Wisconsin Regiment, whose wound was but slight,
had returned to his post, and was at the front.
There Miss Bain was not allowed to follow. But
word soon reached the Captain, and in a day or two
after Miss Bain’s arrival he dashed into camp on
his fine bay horse, well dusted after his long ride.
He was a six-foot, broad-shouldered, ruddy young
Englishman, and was brimming over with anticipation
and happiness.

<p>The first meeting, however, betrayed the secret
that “Bob” was the lover for whom this courageous
girl had braved the perils of the ocean, and
the dangers and uncertainties of a country at war.
Miss Bain explained that “Bob” was her adopted
brother, and she feared that he might die of his
wounds if left to strangers, and so she had come
hoping to take care of him.

<p>Captain Eden was promised a furlough and promotion
but it was long deferred. It was decided
that when the promised furlough came they would
go at once to Washington for the marriage ceremony
and for a honeymoon trip. Bob managed to
get an occasional pass from his regiment, then in
camp before Petersburg always ready for orders to
advance for action.</p>

<p>It was well that Annie had succeeded in gaining
from the department of the Provost Marshal General,
the privilege of remaining till Captain “Bob”
should receive his furlough. And well it was that
the words took that form, for three months passed
and yet no furlough came, while “Bob” stormed
and laughed, impatient, though happy in anticipation,
while he continued to make flying visits to our
quarters.</p>

<p>At last envy, loving a lofty mark, and not knowing
the goodness and purity that were her guide,
sought some explanation of Annie’s quiet reserve
which ungratified curiosity magnified into many
vague surmises, and which were now taking the
form of unpleasant rumor. Annie at last became
conscious of the false position in which she appeared,
and which was chiefly due to the presence
in camp of a handsome young lady having no ostensible
object for her stay.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving and Christmas passed with good
dinners sent to the soldiers by the liberality of citizens,
who also sent agents to assist in the distribution.
Some accessories were supplied by the Hospital
Department, and the ladies in camp, with
much taste and ingenuity in arrangement and decoration
of the stockade dining barracks or “mess
hall,” produced a really fine display, and gave to
the ever unsatisfied convalescent soldier “a good
square meal.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though with womanly tact Annie
endeavored to hide her anxiety, my sympathy
soon discovered “the worm in the bud” that saddened
the eye and paled the cheek of the fair girl.
Something must be done, and that quickly. A
bold thought came to me; but extreme cases require
heroic treatment, and after all we can but
fail.</p>

<p>With assumed indifference, breaking in upon one
of her reveries, I said, “Annie, you are unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Why no, Miss Smith, I am very happy,” she
answered trying to believe herself sincere.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind, I know all about it, Annie,
and am very sorry too, but mean to help you if you
will allow me.”</p>

<p>With an expectant yet alarmed glance she exclaimed:
“Why, what can you do?”</p>

<p>“No matter; but will you answer truly one question?
In the first place you know it is necessary
for me to start for Albany at once to see Governor
Fenton, and Mrs. Painter is called home on business;
and you cannot be left here alone. You are
distressed and unhappy, and with reason; Bob cannot
go to Washington, as you well know, and now
please answer without reserve. If Bob should wish
to marry you here, in camp, will you consent?”</p>

<p>“Why, we could not be married here,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That can be managed if you will give your
answer.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I would,” she replied reluctantly.</p>

<p>But womanly delicacy instantly repented and she
added, “O, I would not for the world have Bob
think I am in the least bit of a hurry.”

<p>“Don’t think of that! He shall never know of
this conversation unless you are willing; and you
will have nothing more to do about it.”</p>

<p>In the course of the next hour a letter was written
to Bob, in which her real position was plainly
set forth, adding the very unpleasant suggestion,
that should he fall in the expected battle, the poor
girl would be doubly miserable. And further, if,
after calm deliberation, he wished to place her
rightly in camp, and marry her here in the Field
Hospital, it was only necessary to telegraph at once
and come to City Point at five P. M. to-morrow,
and it should be done with every arrangement
made.</p>

<p>A rare chance had brought to our tent that day
an officer of Captain Eden’s regiment, by whom
the letter was at once dispatched. Little suspecting
its importance, he delivered it at midnight to
his comrade, as he dreamed by his camp fire of the
long deferred day when Annie should be all his
own. Astonishment and indignation, at the
thought of an injustice to the brave girl who had
dared all in her devotion to him, at once cleared
away the mists of romance that had surrounded
his bright visions of the future.</p>

<p>By the first trembling of the morning wires came
the telegram, “All right, on the way to City Point
on horseback.” This was shown to Annie, who
trembled with anxiety and mortification lest he
should think her deficient in maidenly reserve; but
we laughed away her fears and said nothing. Still
I would not take any decisive action in this emergency
until he came and assured me of his earnest
wish. So the morning wore slowly on until nearly
noon, when Hannah “the great-eyed” stumbled
into the tent,—&#8203;her usual manner of entering,—&#8203;saying,
“Lor, Miss Smith, Mass Bob dun come
ridin’ way down de road, ready to broke him neck.”</p>

<p>I slipped quietly out of the tent as he dashed up
on his fine horse, well flecked with foam, and pulled
rein for the first time in fifteen miles of Virginia
road! Covered with dust, but without a thought
of fatigue, he sprang to the ground and, with a
hearty grasp of my hand, exclaimed, “Colonel,
you’re a trump! Never would have thought it
possible!” and with a significant gesture he whispered,
“Do you mean it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” was the suppressed reply, for tents
are all ears.</p>

<p>Laughingly he continued, “Couldn’t get a pass
so came without it. Ha, ha! must be back to-night!”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no time to lose; go and persuade
Annie, and be ready at five P. M. sharp. It is now
nearly noon, and all is yet to be done.”</p>

<p>With a bound, Bob was by Annie’s side, while
she, half alarmed, was yet too happy in his presence
to speak the thoughts that caused her heart to leap
with a strange emotion.</p>

<p>It must have been like some wild dream when I
said “Annie, Bob has something to say to you
alone; so for once he may enter our sanctum.”
And unpinning the flap of the little tent attached to
a larger one, they disappeared within.</p>

<p>Gathering my scattered thoughts, I ejaculated,
“Let’s see, what first? Ah, here comes Mary
Blackmar. I want you to put on your other dress
and be here at five P. M.”</p>

<p>Her fine hazel eyes dilating in wonder, she exclaimed,
“What ails you, Colonel?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only we are going to have a wedding
in camp, and you’re to be second bridesmaid for
Annie.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped. Manage your work somehow.
You must come just the same, and Mr. Peek
is to stand with you. Good-bye,—&#8203;we’re off for
the clergyman. Remember, five P. M., and, one
moment,—&#8203;not a word in camp.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sister Painter had sent for her orderly
and ambulance, into which I quickly sprang
while she called out with cheery significance,
“Good luck! Good luck!” and the impatient pair
of grey horses dashed off through camp to the
Cavalry Corps Hospital nearly a mile distant, to
secure the services of Chaplain Mines, the only
Episcopal clergyman in that department.</p>

<p>An unusually cold air chilled us as we drove up
to the tasteful little office of the Chaplain. His
orderly saluted, and awaited my order. “Please
ask the Chaplain to step here as quickly as possible.”

<p>To my consternation he replied “Chaplain Mines
went North this morning!”</p>

<p>Dumbfounded at this news, and greatly distressed,
I hardly knew what to do next. The driver
was shivering, and evidently in doubt too, as he
asked “Where shall I drive now?”</p>

<p><span class="lock">“To—to—O,</span> I don’t know—&#8203;that is, drive
back.”</p>

<p>What could be done? Away we sped and my
perplexity increased, for I well knew that none but
the Church of England service could give sanction
to this pair in matrimony. “O, I have it, drive to
the Christian Commission.”</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes we found Mr. Houghton, head
of this commission. “Do you know,” I cried
breathlessly, “you are to be best man at a wedding
this afternoon, and I’m to be first bridesmaid, and—&#8203;well—&#8203;there
is no Episcopalian clergyman in
this camp? You must help us out of this dilemma.
Will you not ask one of your ministers to perform
the service by the Episcopal form?”</p>

<p>With a twinkle in his keen gray eye he remarked
“I think I shall order a straight jacket, <span class="lock">and—”</span></p>

<p>“Never mind! Order what you like, but not a
word in camp, or we shall have more assistance
than we desire. Though this must not be done in a
corner, yet one from each post will suffice. If it
gets out we might have hundreds. We ladies will
represent the States, Mr. Peek the Sanitary Commission,
and you, Mr. Houghton, the Christian
Commission, and—&#8203;at five P. M. you’ll know the
rest, for there is yet much to do. I’m off now for
General Patrick.”</p>

<p>Again we dashed off over the rough frozen roads,
this time in the direction of General Grant’s Headquarters,
near the James side of the Point. The
day was intensely cold, and only a guard was visible,
marking his frozen beat. As we approached
he called an orderly, who immediately appeared
and received the message “Ask General Patrick if
he can be seen.”</p>

<p>“General Patrick went North yesterday!”</p>

<p>“How long will he remain?”</p>

<p>“Till to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>Match-making was becoming a doubtful experiment.
“Has everybody gone North?” I dubiously
inquired.</p>

<p>The orderly suggested “The General’s adjutant,
Captain Beckwith is here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, I don’t know <em>him</em> except by sight;
a young man and good-looking. If only he wasn’t.
Wonder what General Grant would say if he were
asked!” But a consideration of the cares of that
overworked public servant saved <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>At last, in desperation, I said, “Ask the Adjutant
if he will please step here for a moment,” inwardly
adding “If we do not perish with cold in this attempt,
we might hereafter make our headquarters
at the North Pole!”</p>

<p>Captain Beckwith came out of the office and politely
waited my request. A poor attempt at indifference
was not helped by my hesitating words—&#8203;“Captain,
<span class="lock">I—er—I</span> wish to speak to you
privately. Is your office occupied?”</p>

<p>He replied gravely and politely, “There are
officers now in my tent.”</p>

<p>“Well then, will you please step into the ambulance,
as it is necessary to have your advice and
assistance.”</p>

<p>Apparently anticipating a torpedo, when only a
flag of truce was offered,—&#8203;rather dimly to be
sure,—&#8203;he cautiously took his seat without a word.</p>

<p>How shall I quickly explain? Why doesn’t he
say something—&#8203;not a word—&#8203;one or the other
must drop preliminary caution, or the words will
freeze on our lips. So I blundered out “Are you
engaged at five P. M.?”</p>

<p>He replied that he thought he was. Whereupon
I told him the whole story, and he soon changed his
plans.</p>

<p>“As General Patrick is away,” I said, “will you
come and witness the ceremony?”</p>

<p>“But I’m afraid <span class="lock">it——”</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense, Miss Bain has remained by permission
of General Patrick. We wish you, as his representative,
to give your countenance and endorsement
to the affair.”</p>

<p>Now he was interested, and finally agreed to be
on hand. Away we hurried back to the Christian
Commission, and found we had only two hours left.</p>

<p>After returning from the Cavalry Corps Hospital
I found Bob within the tent standing alone
with a gloomy and discontented expression upon
his face. I took the alarm and said quickly:
“There is something wrong, Bob. If you are intending
to marry Annie because you think you
must, don’t do it, she’s too good a girl to be forced
upon any man in that manner. Now is your time
to retreat. What is the matter?”</p>

<p>With a merry laugh, Bob said soothingly:
“There, there, Colonel, you are wasting ammunition.
Why, don’t you know that nothing in the
world could make me so happy as to marry the
dear girl, and if we succeed I can never repay this
great kindness, so don’t waste time or thought on
that point!”</p>

<p>But the cloud once more passed over his face.
What did it mean? Half repenting the new role, I
was hurrying away, when a neglected message
came to my mind, and I called out, “O, Bob!
Major Baker, before going North, requested me to
say he had left forty dollars for you with the sutler
at the Point!”</p>

<p>The cloud vanished, as he sprang up and exclaimed:
“Did he? Bless his old heart! I must
run down and get it.”</p>

<p>“Why, how delighted you seem; one would think
it was a fortune.”</p>

<p>“O no,—but you see—&#8203;er well, it is—&#8203;all
right now.”</p>

<p>The cloud was explained! How mortal we are!
The poor fellow was “dead broke” and of course
had no fee for the clergyman. This seemed a small
matter, but for several months that ever-welcome
individual, the Pay-master, had not reported to the
consequently bankrupt “front,” so there was nothing
to borrow, for as long as a dollar remained in
camp, it was the common property of the “Boys.”</p>

<p>On the road shortly after, we met Bob beaming
as a sunflower, radiant in a brand new pair of yellow
buckskin gauntlets, high cavalry boots, freshly
blacked, hair and beard barbered, dust swept off
his faded uniform, and with a clean paper collar.
The owner of this elegant wedding attire called out
merrily—&#8203;“How are you progressing, Colonel?”</p>

<p>“Finely,” was the brief though hardly conscientious
reply, which was scarcely verified on reaching
the Christian Commission again, when Mr. Houghton
said: “I can find no one willing to perform
that ceremony!”</p>

<p>Descending from the ambulance and passing into
the quarters occupied by <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. and Mrs. A., I
asked the former to assist in giving away the bride,
which he at once consented to do. But the most
important character was still wanting.</p>

<p>“Ah, <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> G., will you not as a home friend
kindly perform this service?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure by the Methodist form, but I
have conscientious scruples about using another
service!”</p>

<p>“Well, please send some one else.”</p>

<p>This one had scruples too. This seemed an
absurd prejudice to stand in the way of so much
happiness. The fourth or fifth minister was “perfectly
willing” but hadn’t the least idea of an Episcopal
service. Verily this was the pursuit of happiness
under difficulties. But I rejoiced then that
all obstacles seemed to be at last overcome. Grateful
to this liberal Methodist minister I thanked him
and said: “If you are willing, please wait a moment.”</p>

<p>Running quickly to Mr. Houghton, he soon found
a prayer book and a key,—&#8203;not of the book but
of the chapel door. How the time flew! Four
hours and thirty minutes gone; only twenty-five
minutes left! The minister and I entered the
chapel, where I explained to him the form of the
Episcopal service, and to save time enacted the part
of the groom, the bride and the other necessary
characters. Much delighted with this service, he
was proceeding finely when we came to the giving
of the ring. “Oh, how about the ring,” he asked.
Here was another dilemma. Shades of the Goddess
of Matrimony! A ring! and in camp, where
jewelry was conspicuous only by its absence! My
only ring, a garnet cluster, would not serve for a
wedding ring, yet a ring must be had. Leaving
the reverend absorbed in his part I ran to the tent
again and rushed in upon Bob and Annie, happy
and quite oblivious of time, forgetting almost my
presence, and that it was for <em>their</em> marriage, that I
had stirred up every department in the great hospital
and the U. S. Headquarters.</p>

<p>In a tone of dismay I exclaimed: “What shall
we do for a ring? It is impossible to find one in
this last moment.”

<p>But to my intense amazement and great relief
Miss Bain in a most matter of fact manner replied,
“Why, I have a plain ring in my valise.” This she
placed in my hand, and I gave it to Bob, who deposited
it safely for the auspicious moment. So I
sped happily away, calling back, “Be ready in five
minutes!”</p>

<p>And now we must marshal our forces and prepare
for the silent wedding march, for which no
Mendelssohn or Lohengrin could give sweet music,
and which must be under cover to avoid attracting
attention. At this moment an orderly hastily entered
saying, “Mr. A. is very sorry, but a telegram
has ordered him directly to the Point, and Mr. Peek
is nowhere to be found!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has taken a telegraphic shock, too!”</p>

<p>“All the rest here?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but now, Captain Beckwith, you must be
promoted to second groomsman.”</p>

<p>Ignoring his objections in this latest emergency,
I turned to Mrs. Painter, asking: “Will you give
away the bride, thus standing for her mother?”</p>

<p>Equal to any emergency she replied: “We
Friends do not understand thy services, but what
will thee have me to do?”</p>

<p>“There is no time now to study up, but when the
Pastor asks ‘Who giveth this woman to be married
to this man?’ just step forward and say, ‘I do’.”</p>

<p>There was no danger of failure there. “Now
wait until I run again to the chapel, to see if our
minister is sufficiently coached, and then let the
conquering victims come!”</p>

<p>The good man was ready, and quite delighted
with the beautiful service. When we disagreed
about the positions to be taken, he good-naturedly
allowed himself to be backed against the rough
little pulpit, and with an expression of amused curiosity
prepared for the now waiting couple.</p>

<p>Perhaps a dozen camp friends had quietly entered
and seated themselves to witness the ceremony,
and all was ready. Hastily returning once
more to our tent, and finding every one ready, and
fearing that our little secret might be discovered,
we ordered “Double quick.” Bob and I went first
together, the two groomsmen and bridesmaid entered
from different directions. Sister Painter
came next with the bride, and even in her well
worn, patched brown ‘every day’, with travelling
hat and pretty collar, she seemed quite beautiful.
Hannah covered the retreat.</p>

<p>As we arranged our little wedding procession,
the solemnity of the occasion became impressive,
while the shades of evening struggled through the
bare windows of the large chapel, and the gleam of
half a dozen candles cast a glow over the Pastor’s
form as he stood, book in hand, awaiting the first
sight of the twain, now slowly approaching. All
fell, quietly and orderly, into position. And there,
far from home and dear friends, in the roughly
boarded, unplaned, unpainted structure where “the
Boys in Blue” so often gathered to hear the words
of love and truth, was solemnly performed the
beautiful ceremony, without a pause or interruption,
which joined two loving hearts as one in holy
bonds, never to be severed on earth. “Whom God
hath joined together, let no man put asunder.”</p>

<p>More than one silent tear of thankfulness fell as
the last prayer died away on the lips of the good
man, who had so beautifully solemnized this institution.</p>

<p>Night had now fallen as all joyfully congratulated
the noble looking, happy pair. They walked
arm in arm, man and wife, back to our tents, where
we quietly followed, no rumor having reached the
alert ears of the poor weary fellows, anxious for a
break in the monotony of hospital life.</p>

<p>The guests at the reception in our large tent consisted
only of our own little party, and the refreshments
were composed of a couple of bottles of Sister
Painter’s home-made wine, and a “wolverine”
cake, hastily made by Mary Blackmar’s willing
hands.</p>

<p><abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <span class="lock">——</span> wrote the certificate, and we had a
merry time in witnessing it; while our tent was illuminated
with two extra candles in bottles, and
the wind made sweet music above our laughter on
the swaying canvas roof. The great black log
blazed brightly, now and then snapping out a sharp
shout of joy, and all went merrily as the traditional
marriage bell.</p>

<p>Bob, of course, was obliged to return at once to
his regiment; leaving his bride for a day or two
while he cleaned up his regimental quarters, and
obtained permission to go to housekeeping where
bullets rained and shells stormed, and thither he
took his happy bride.</p>

<p>About two weeks later came the furlough, and
the Major’s commission. On my return from my
interview with Governor Fenton in Albany, I met
the wedded pair in Washington, going North,
where their festivities were continued among their
friends with suitable formalities.

<h3>NEW YORK STATE AGENCY</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Quite</span> unknown to me, the State Agents and
the two Commissions had formulated an appeal
to have me supersede Mrs. Spencer,
then New York State Agent in the field, and urged
that I go at once to Governor Fenton at Albany to
have it confirmed. So the day after the wedding I
started for New York on a government transport.</p>

<p>Mr. Houghton was also going North. The
rumor of a wedding had already spread over camp,
and Mr. Houghton and I were congratulated as the
happy couple on our wedding trip. This caused a
great deal of merriment.</p>

<p>Captain Blackman of the transport, was very
kind and made the trip on the shabby boat quite
pleasant. My little cabin was suffocating at night,
and I left my door open with a light burning in the
narrow passage-way, while the engineer and his
wife slept opposite. Quite exhausted with preparations
for the wedding and for my trip North, I
fell into a heavy sleep. Some time during the night
I was awakened by heavy hands passing up and
down my body. I awoke in total darkness, and
was too dazed at first to comprehend the situation,
but at last I managed to exclaim “Who are you,
and what do you want?”

<p>A coarse voice, in broken English, said, “I want
a place to sleep!”</p>

<p>I called for a light and help, when in a very calm
manner the intruder said: “O, don’t put yourself
in a stew!” On his hastily retreating footsteps I
quickly closed and locked the door. The engineer
had doubtless extinguished the light in the passage
before he closed their door.</p>

<p>The next day we stopped at Fortress Monroe,
and were allowed to examine the interior of the
Fort, and that great mounted black gun called
“The Swamp Angel” which was reputed to throw
a shot of four hundred pounds!</p>

<p>In Washington we met our old friend Major
Baker; and when we walked up Pennsylvania Avenue
toward the Capitol we saw the effect of an
unusual freak of the wind. A large flag was flying
at the top from either wing of the great building
and both flags blew in towards each other, standing
out immovable without a fold as if held by some
material background. The effect was peculiar.</p>

<p>But I spent little time sight-seeing, and took the
afternoon train for New York.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at my home in Bedford Avenue,
Brooklyn, there were many matters to attend to,
and I had little time to spend with my family. I
then started for Albany. At Troy we crossed the
river in a sleigh on thick ice. I had been invited
to stop at the home of my former patient John C.
Guffin, where I met his father, mother and brother.
The parents reminded me of Abraham and Sarah.
They seemed to have dropped out of the Old Testament,
as they talked in Scripture language quite
difficult for me to understand.</p>

<p>The hilly streets of Albany were covered with
ice, and although a natural climber, I could not keep
my footing, and so I simply sat down and slid to
the bottom of those hills. Governor Fenton was
away when I arrived, and I was obliged to remain
three days waiting for him. During this time these
hospitable patriarchs gave me, three times a day,
only buckwheat cakes and tea, which peculiar diet
caused a severe headache. I was very glad when I
could get away. I never experienced such cold as
during that visit.</p>

<p>Governor Fenton was very courteous, and, after
examining the appeal made by all the State Agencies,
the Sanitary and Christian Commissions, he
soon granted the request and gave me the Commission
of New York State agent, with directions
to report to Mr. Morgan, head of New York State
Agency in Washington.</p>

<p>On my return to Washington I met Mr. Morgan,
and received from him the following commission:</p>
<br>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“New York State Agency,&emsp;<br>
181 Pennsylvania Avenue,<br>
Washington, D. C., February 22, 1865.&emsp;<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">Colonel T. S. Bowers,<br>
&emsp;A. A. G. Armies, United States.</p>

<p class="unindent">Sir:</p>

<p>Miss Ada W. Smith has been appointed agent of
the State of New York for the relief of her soldiers.

<p>I respectfully commend her to your kind consideration,
assuring you that every facility given her for
carrying out the object of her mission will be appreciated.</p>

<p class="right r2">
<span style="margin-right: 5em;">Very truly,</span><br>
D. G. MORGAN,<br>
Supt. N. Y. S. Military Agency.”<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Mr. Morgan directed me to report to City Point
and to relieve Mrs. Spencer.</p>

<p>On my return to City Point I met Major and
Mrs. Eden. Having received his promotion and a
furlough, they were on their wedding trip North.
I was glad to return to City Point camp life and
duty, with congratulations on all sides. The next
day, with an ambulance and a friend, I went to Mrs.
Spencer’s quarters and showed her my commission,
saying, “I would like to take possession in a few
days.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Spencer had been charged with partiality
to McClellan men, and refusing Republican soldiers
tobacco, etc. Politics, even in the army, caused
many somersaults, and were quite beyond my management;
and through some strategy my commission
was revoked at City Point, though I retained
the commission as New York agent in general!</p>

<p>There were then some indications of the collapse
of the Confederacy, and that when this frightful
war was over the agencies would also collapse.
However, I kept on working in the old way, while
my indignant Republican friends threatened, and
tried to storm the New York State Agency. Politics
ran high and many lost their heads politically.
Many convalescent copperheads and Democrats,
enlisted men, were allowed to go home to vote for
president.</p>

<p>Doctor Painter, a strong Republican, incurred
the displeasure of General Patrick, a Democrat, by
some manipulations which enabled her to get
enough passes for Jersey soldiers to go home to
vote and so balance the Democratic vote.</p>

<p>Many one-armed and one-legged men were moving
about camp, waiting orders to report to Washington,
where the Government would supply them
with artificial limbs and discharge them. It was
surprising how many were well fitted with these
limbs, and that many could walk so well that only a
slight limp betrayed them; while others with neatly
gloved hands, which they could sometimes use
quite well, were seldom observed in passing.</p>

<p>A young lieutenant from Maine, had lost a leg,
and was lying, weary and helpless, on his hospital
cot. He had written, as had many another poor
fellow crippled for life, to his fiancée, offering to
resign his claim, and he was now feverishly awaiting
her reply. Day after day passed, and still no
answer, while we tried every device to encourage
him. He said “I know how it will be!” He became
bitter and scornful and made no effort to live.
While it was scarcely possible in any case that he
could recover from this usually fatal thigh fracture,
we still hoped that he might at least receive some
word of comfort before he died.</p>

<p>I seldom went into the wards after nightfall, but
the dying boy sent for me quite late one night.
Hoping that some kind word had come at last, I
hastened to his side. None had come and, conscious
that his life was fast ebbing away, he had
only bitterness for his former sweetheart and died
with these cruel thoughts.</p>

<p>I wrote his friend, simply announcing his death;
but a few days later came her reply, full of grief.
She had received no letter, nor knew anything of
his wounds. They had been friends from childhood
and she could not believe she would never see
him again. “Had he not mentioned her or left
some word?” My reply was the saddest and most
difficult of all sad letters, for—&#8203;“It might have
been.” I tried to think of some word which he
had dropped which might be happily construed,
and I certainly strained a point to give this poor
heart-stricken girl some little comfort to remember
from the boy lover of her childhood.</p>

<p>A few days later his comrades carried him to a
mournful tune of fife and drum, and fired a last
salute over his lonely grave.</p>

<h3>A HOUSE MOVING</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">General Collis</span>, then in command of the
colored brigade at the Point, on abandoning
his adjutant’s little frame house or office
about fifteen feet by ten, kindly gave it to me. A
large army wagon on which it was raised, for removal,
supported by a squad of soldiers on either
side, and hauled by six mules, made quite an impression
coming up Agency Row, especially as it
carried away the telegraph wires over the road.
One of our large tents was moved to give it space,
and the real door and little glass window in it made
us quite the envy of the Row. It was divided into
two rooms, having a tent roof. The front room
was for business purposes. The smaller, which
had a window about a foot square, was large
enough only for a bunk with a straw bed, a packing
box for a dresser, a hand glass and a barrel chair,
and so New York was added to Pennsylvania and
New Jersey Agencies.</p>

<p>This recalls a night incident somewhat later,
when Mrs. Painter and I were sleeping in the bunk.
I was startled by Mrs. Painter springing up on to
the dresser and screaming loudly, “Murder!
Thieves! Help!” almost in the face of a scamp
at the window, who was evidently trying to reach
the wines hidden under the dresser. Mrs. Painter
was a very small woman of the old time Quaker
stamp, and she wore a little white night cap, and
the proverbial short gown and petticoat. As the
poor fellow took to his heels and the neighbouring
tents were aroused, I could only lie still and laugh
at the ludicrous scene. He lost a great army shoe
which rested conspicuously on a rise of ground,
quite distant.</p>

<p>Another amusing incident comes to my mind in
connection with my little house. One night there
came a thundering knock on the door, on which
remained the word “Adjutant.” On opening I
found a soldier standing at attention and more than
“half-seas-over,” so that he could not distinguish
a woman from an officer. He had been on furlough,
and insisted on my taking his pass, but at
last I succeeded in starting him for the proper
office.</p>

<p>An incident occurs to me of a New York newspaper
reporter who was invited to the mess of General
Grant and staff. While drinking was more
common than now, no one so far forgot himself as
to become intoxicated in the presence of the General,
whose self-control and rigid discipline all respected.
But this man so demeaned himself as to
“get under the table,” and the officers present
were excited to the utmost contempt and indignation
at this breach of etiquette in the presence of
the commander of the United States Armies. If
intoxication had been common at Headquarters,
camp gossip would certainly have travelled the half
mile to the state agencies and brought us news of
it. General Grant, however, was unhappily addicted
to the excessive use of tobacco, which
eventually caused him much suffering, and, later,
his life.</p>


<p class="p2 center">MISS JONES, OF PHILADELPHIA</p>

<p>How few, even of the army veterans, remember
the sacrifices of the “Women of the War” in hospitals,
homes and elsewhere! In the many G. A.
R. annual Memorial services held since the war,
when they are received in churches to hear their
heroic deeds extolled, never have I heard a chaplain
or minister give a thought of the women workers,
by whose faithful care many of these brave soldiers
were nursed back to life, and restored to their
anxious families and to the country.</p>

<p>Miss Jones, of Philadelphia, was one of these
rare, forgotten workers. Accomplished, refined,
though delicate, she left her luxurious home with
its order and comforts, to give her time, strength
and means to the principles of national liberty, inbred
into the life of every citizen of Philadelphia
by the frequent sight of the old cradle of the
American flag, the little home of Betsey Ross,
where, under the direction of General Washington,
Lafayette and others—&#8203;she sewed into the bunting
the thirteen stars and stripes of our national
emblem. A million subscribers, at ten cents each,
have enabled the Association to make it a national
or State reservation in the densest business section
of the city, where it has become a national Mecca
to thousands yearly visiting the City of Brotherly
Love.

<p>Miss Jones, on arriving at City Point Hospital,
at once took up the rough camp life in an army
tent with earth floor,—&#8203;often damp and wet,—&#8203;a
little cot, an apology for a table, barrel chairs, the
usual chimney built roughly of logs and mud with
barrel top, the plain and sometimes distasteful food,
and the atmosphere of the sick wards. Here, however,
she worked for many weeks in that enthusiastic
ardor which inspired her kindly heart, feeling
that she was giving help, comfort, and perhaps life,
to the sick who came under her care.</p>

<p>Thoughtless of self, and with failing strength,
she continued to work ceaselessly, till, contracting
typhoid fever, she collapsed quite suddenly, but
still hoped that rest in the bare lonely tent might
restore her to her hospital work.</p>

<p>I had been too much occupied with my sick Boys
even to see Miss Jones, though much interested in
her, having lived near her in Philadelphia some
years before the war; and the sad news came with
a shock that this frail, devoted soul had sacrificed
her life to her country and died in the field, like
many a true soldier and patriot, far from friends
and the home where every tender luxury was awaiting
her.</p>

<p>Doctor Painter and I volunteered to sit beside
her slight form during the night, which was intensely
cold, while a full moon shed its silvery rays
over the phantom of midnight silence in camp, and
glittered like rare crystals on the pure white snow
that seemed to reach the distant horizon, whence
the brilliant stars looked down in love and pity.
Mrs. Painter and I sat on rough chairs with our
feet on logs, while the fire logs in the crude chimney
burned brightly. Mrs. Painter, who had been
among the first women to reach the front, meanwhile
told me many a tale of her strange experiences
when system had not reached the improvised
temporary hospital tents, where many suffered for
help and nourishment then unattainable. So the
night passed, while the moaning wind sang “Rest,
sweet soul,” often slightly swaying the white sheet
that covered the pallid body. More than once we
started quickly to the seeming motion of life,
hoping it might be real, but the pure spirit had
passed on, while the frail body rested with a pleasant
smile, calmly, as if tended by the friends of
home and the formalities of a last funeral service
for the dead.</p>

<p>Her brother, Horatio, came for the body, and at
last it was laid away among her ancestors in the
family lot near Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Recognition of her services has been given in
Philadelphia by the naming of one of the G. A. R.
Posts “the Hetty Jones Post.”</p>

<p>The only other post that I have ever heard of
named after a woman is the Betsey Ross Post, also
of Philadelphia.</p>

<h3>THE LAST PARADE OF CONFEDERATE
PRISONERS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am quite confident that Love was the only rope
thrown out to us by Heaven when we fell overboard
into life.”—&#8203;Sidney Lanier.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">General Grant</span> had ordered a grand attack
all along the lines from Appomattox to
Hatches Run. This was the fateful move
that crushed the Confederate Army, and opened the
way to Petersburg and Richmond on April <abbr title="third">3d</abbr>.</p>

<p>The paroled and surrendered Confederate prisoners
were at once marched forward from Petersburg
on the road beside the hospital. It was a strange,
sad sight, this long line of Confederate prisoners,
3,000 strong, officers and men without arms,—&#8203;some
by habit reaching for the forfeited sword,
belt, or gun,—&#8203;worn, tired, begrimed figures of
despair. They were clothed in every degree of
shabbiness, from the dulled tinsel of the uniformed
officers, to the worn, faded, ragged grey that they
had so confidently donned at the beginning of the
war. They were on their way to City Point under
guard, many to be forwarded to some Northern
camp, where at least their starving bodies would be
fed and made comfortable.</p>

<p>There was no sound of exultation over the conquered
enemy among the Northern men and
women standing quietly near to see them pass.
Some even saluted the defeated Confederate
officers. None showed the slightest disrespect to
those unfortunates who had not only lost, in a
futile war against their own nation, the “Flower
of their Chivalry,” but their broad acres were devastated
and had become battle fields of frightful
carnage and struggle, and their homes were also
wrecked, leaving many without shelter, and thus
depriving hundreds of any present means of support.
As they marched slowly by, in painful silent
dejection, did they realize the folly of an ill-advised
rebellion, to which they had sacrificed lives, homes
and sustenance to an illogical, unethical romantic
ideal?</p>

<p>Crowds of barefoot, ragged negroes, nearly nude,
who had been shut up for years in Petersburg, now
crowded by hundreds along the road. One excited
old woman, her head covered with a faded
bandana, exclaimed: “Lor, dere goes ole Mars, I
knows him shore. Can’t tech me now. I’se a free
nigger.” Another shouted to us, “I knows you
alls Yankee ladies, de Lord bress you.”</p>

<p>It seemed like a funeral procession, without fife
and drum, as it wound slowly past the hospital to
City Point United States Headquarters, there to
take their parole.</p>

<p>About this time, at City Point, I saw General
Custer, who lost his life soon after in the Indian
raids. He was a small, spare, nervous man, wearing
a scarlet-lined cape thrown over his shoulder,
and his long light hair floated back, making a
striking picture of a cavalryman as his spirited
horse dashed from one headquarters to another.</p>

<h3>OUR FIRST SIGHT OF PETERSBURG</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> advance on Petersburg occurred on
April <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>, 1865. It was about 3.30 A. M.
when our troops entered the city, and all
were anxious to see the city so long besieged and
coveted.</p>

<p>Two days later, on the 4th, a party of about
twenty-five officers and ladies of the hospital, some
well mounted, some in ambulances, started in high
exultation for the conquered city. I was happy in
being mounted on a beautiful white horse, with a
crimson saddle cloth, loaned from United States
Headquarters. I wore a dark blue habit with infantry
buttons, a fatigue cap with chin strap, riding
gloves, and carried a small whip. The horse acted
as if trained for a circus, full of antics as a pet dog.
In defiance of rein and whip he walked on every
stray log, into ditches, or puddles of water in the
road, first raising his haunches to feel if I were firm
in the saddle, and travelled with a “lope” as easy
as a rocking chair, so that after twenty-five miles I
was not in the least tired.</p>

<p>We rode over the fields of the last skirmish, torn
ground, destroyed entrenchments, the “Cheveaux
de frieze,” broken and scattered among clothing,
canteens and the general debris of a battle-field.
At the outskirts of the city we saw great “gopher
holes” dug in the sides of hills, where the inhabitants
crowded daily to escape the shells that were
constantly falling into the doomed city. In these
holes they were safe until nightfall, when firing
usually ceased and the weary women and children
returned to their homes to sleep until another day.
Shots passed through many houses but it was surprising
that so little had been destroyed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption">GENERAL O. B. WILCOX</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Having previously met General O. B. Wilcox,
who was then in command of the city, we rode to
his headquarters, where I introduced our party.
He received us courteously, giving us a mounted
escort, that no trouble might ensue while we made
a tour of the almost deserted city. The windows
were all closed, as for some national mourning.
There was only one foolish demonstration, by some
young women on a piazza, who made grimaces at
our handsome officers, and gyrated their fingers at
them in a most remarkable manner. I was sorry
and indignant for this petty spite, but our brave
men merely smiled without comment.</p>

<p>The houses were generally detached, small and
shabby, showing little to interest beside occasional
marks made by stray shot. While riding through
the town we saw an old gentleman weeding his
garden, and I made the excuse of asking for a glass
of water, which was politely given. I said to him,
“You appear to be taking things very quietly.”</p>

<p>In his strong Southern accent, he replied: “Oh
yes; you uns have us beaten, and we might as well
make the best of it and go to work.”</p>

<p>During this memorable day in Petersburg we had
visited our old friend Bob Eden, who became editor
of the Petersburg Progress, a Confederate paper,
immediately after the occupation of the city; and
he, like his comrades, was wild with joy at the turn
of things, political and national.</p>

<p>The following from “Grant’s” Petersburg
Progress appeared the day after our visit. The
paper is still in my possession, but it has nearly
fallen in pieces. There was no supply of printer’s
blank paper, and the Confederates had been obliged
to use one side of wall paper, or anything else that
would hold print.</p>

<p>To see the victorious veterans of the Army returning
and marching through Petersburg was a
never-to-be-forgotten sight. As we sat, mounted,
at the corner of a street, they marched by with easy
swinging tramp, by hundreds and thousands, dust-begrimed,
in faded threadbare blue uniforms that
they had worn through many a bloody battle, and
in which they had slept many nights, often in
swamps, and mud on the battle-fields. The shabby
knapsacks, battered canteens, ragged blankets,
their well-polished old guns, the only fresh clean
emblem in sight; and these for the most part were
shouldered as if for a holiday, which in very truth
it was, probably the happiest they ever enjoyed.
Discipline of the tired host was quite forgotten,
while the worn, faded, torn flags floated out
proudly.</p>

<p>The Eighth Wisconsin Infantry had some time
before sent home their mascot “Old Abe,” the hero
of twenty battles and many skirmishes. This eagle
was taken from its nest by an Indian and presented
to Company C., where it became the pet of the regiment.
During attacks he was carried at the front
on a standard, near the flag,—&#8203;sometimes held by
a long cord or chain,—&#8203;he would rise up flapping
his great wings, and screeching defiance at the
enemy loudly enough to be heard along the line.
His reputation made thousands of dollars at fairs
and elsewhere. His portrait was painted, and
hangs in the Old South Church, Boston. The
State pensioned Old Abe and supported an attendant
to care for him. He died at last of old age, and
his skin is stuffed and safely preserved in the state
archives at Madison, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>As these men tramped to the music of the shrill
fife and drum, that knew no rest that day, they
sometimes joined in a great chorus, meanwhile
cheering themselves hoarse, to the tunes of
“Johnny Came Marching Home,” “Yankee Doodle,”
and many an army song.</p>

<p>When some former patients recognized us, surgeons
and nurses who had cared for them, they
broke all bounds, and, with uncovered heads,
dipped their tattered flags and fairly roared their
thanks in grateful cheers, while we waved our caps
and handkerchiefs in return and also cheered. The
magnetism of a home-going victorious army spread
like a prairie fire, not only from regiment to regiment,
but extended to every individual in their
presence, while a roar as if of ocean waves spread
over the sea of happy men and women.</p>

<p>This was a day of great rejoicing and enthusiasm
among soldiers and Northerners, never to be forgotten.
Taking leave of our polite escort, and
thanking General Wilcox for his kindness, the
mounted party took a spirited gallop back to hospital
camp.

<p>Strict hospital discipline was relaxed and the men
were singing “Home, Sweet Home,” “Yankee
Doodle,” “John Brown’s Body,” “Marching
Through Georgia,” and many other patriotic
songs, enjoying them equally, until taps ordered
“Lights out,” when the whole camp soon fell into
peaceful dreams of home.</p>

<h3>PREPARING FOR A VISIT TO RICHMOND, THE
CAPITAL OF THE LOST CONFEDERACY</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom
to the free.”—&#8203;Abraham Lincoln.</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after the evacuation and capture
of Richmond, a small party led by Mr. J.
Yates Peek, of Brooklyn, still superintendent
of the Sanitary Commission at City Point, arranged
to make an early start on the morning of April 11th,
to see the smoking city. Everything must be arranged
over night, and I planned so as to jump
quickly into my clothing, placing my only pair of
good boots on a near-by chair, to lose no time. But
in the morning, almost at the last moment, the
boots were missing. When all had joined in the
search, to no effect, the mystery increased.</p>

<p>We had a boy orderly, named Jack, who was
more officious than useful, and often much in the
way, and he volunteered in the search. Returning
to my little room after a moment’s absence, to my
astonishment I beheld the boy on the floor with his
head in my trunk, which he had had the temerity
to unlock. He was rummaging and disarranging
everything as if with a pudding stick. I exclaimed:
“Jack, what are you doing?” in no pleasant tone
of voice.</p>

<p>“I thought the shoes might be in the trunk,” he
quite coolly replied, “but I’ve been through every
darned thing in it and they ain’t there.”</p>

<p>Words were, at that hurried moment, quite inadequate.
An explanation of the loss of the shoes
came later. We had removed a small stove and
left the pipe hole open on the side between two
tents, and during the night some ambitious contraband
probably had squeezed into the small space
between the tents, and with a long stick had
“gobbled” my only pair of decent shoes.</p>

<p>What could I do? I must go somewhere, as the
party were not willing to go without me. Fortunately,
Miss Dupee, assistant in the Maine State
Agency, had a pair which fitted quite well and she
very kindly loaned them to me. One of the pleasant
associations of agency life in camp was the
camaraderie that made all things in common, just
as the soldier shared his last ration or his last dollar
with another comrade in the field.</p>

<p>Owing to this delay, we were barely able to catch
the boat as it was pushing off at City Point Dock.
A pleasant sail on the James River brought us to
the dock of the Seven-Hilled City, directly into the
burned and still smoking district.</p>

<p>The fleeing citizens in their short-sighted frenzy,
had determined to destroy the whole city. But
thanks to the efforts of the Federal soldiers, chiefly
colored, the greater part of the city was saved for
them, while the factories and warehouses continued
to smoke and burn for many weeks.</p>

<p>It was this same obstructed wharf and destroyed
dock over which the President climbed, holding
little Tad by the hand. They passed through the
burned district, against the protest of a small escort,
while jostled by a rough crowd.</p>

<p>Blessed by the grateful negroes crowding around
the great Emancipator, some kneeling and kissing
the hem of his coat, he strode fearlessly on among
enemies and friends.</p>

<p>A significant fact to be forever cherished by the
freed race is that General Weitzel, with the 25th
Corps d’ Afric, took possession of the conquered
city; and further that a colored soldier carried the
President’s United States flag before him into the
heart of Richmond, where it was raised over the
Capitol, and Richmond was once more and forever
in the Union.</p>

<p>The Capitol, a modest building with white columns
and dome, was uninjured. There were many
comfortable-looking detached houses, with yards or
gardens pleasant to see after the bare tent life at
City Point Hospital.</p>

<p>We dined at Spotswood Hotel, still managed by
a Confederate host, where we greatly enjoyed fresh
peas and corn. We were rather disappointed by
the plainness of the gray mastic front of the three-storied
double medium house of Jefferson Davis,
both inside and out, with only a door yard in front,
where I gathered some leaves which are still in my
possession.</p>

<p>We saw the entrance to the tunnel that was dug
by starving, desperate Yankee prisoners, almost in
full view of the guards, quite near Libby prison, and
by which many had escaped to freedom, thus bringing
more deprivation and abuse upon the despairing
prisoners left behind.</p>

<p>All was now changed in the city. The inhabitants
finding they were not pursued or in any way
molested, were gradually returning to their homes
and buildings that they had not succeeded in destroying.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Libby Prison remained; a weather-stained brick
tobacco storehouse, the former scene of so much
suffering and indignity. But the tables were now
turned. The brutal turnkey, Captain Richard
Turner, by name, I think, was now himself a
prisoner. He was a stocky, brutal-looking fellow.
All people were allowed to pass and look through a
small open window at the miserable wretch, while
he defiantly mounted a stool in the middle of the
room to show himself more conspicuously. That
morning a former prisoner had cajoled him into
coming close to the small window, where the man
struck through and felled him to the ground as he
said: “Take that for the pail of filth you threw over
me while I was a helpless prisoner.”</p>

<p>When the formal announcement of the final surrender
of General Lee to General Grant, at Appomattox,
on the 9th of April, 1865, was confirmed in
the camp, all knew that at last the “cruel war”
was over. There was great rejoicing in the hospital,
and all began to prepare to go North, or home
again, after so many weary years of struggle.
Some wept for joy as they wrote to the weary waiting
watchers at home; some were to carry to their
friends and neighbors the last words and deeds of
the many who slept beneath the soil of Virginia, or
further south, while their comrades “went marching
on.” The workers of the Agencies and the
Commissions had so long labored in the same spirit
that we were much like a large united family; and
until we departed one by one for our homes, we did
not realize how close was the bond of sympathy and
affection, that could never be forgotten.

<h3>RECOLLECTIONS OF LINCOLN</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be
enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must
not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords
of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot
grave to every living heart and hearthstone, all over
this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union,
when again touched, as surely they will be by the
better angels of our nature.”—&#8203;Abraham Lincoln.</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">During</span> the last year of the war I was still
working for the “Boys” at City Point
Depot Field Hospital, Virginia, half a mile
from the headquarters of the United States Armies
in the field, at the junction of the Appomattox and
James Rivers, when the day of the second inaugural
drew near. This caused a welcome ripple of
excitement to spread over the daily monotony of
discipline in hospital camp life. The fearless President
was to stand once more before the people to
take the oath to uphold the institutions and principles
of his country, despite the state policy as well
as humanity that had compelled the passing of the
Emancipation Act, that had cut the last thread of
hope for the return of “the good old days” of the
South.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p class="p2">When Abraham Lincoln, with superhuman courage,
made that moral stroke of the pen that gave
freedom to millions of slaves, then was born at last
a free country, not only in name, but in the glorious
fact that had blotted out from our country’s escutcheon
the shame of human slavery that had so
long branded our vaunted freedom as a disgrace.
The people, the great middle class, the saviours of
freedom who in great crises rise to a national
emergency like a towering Gibraltar, had risen to
uphold the weary hands of him who loved his
country more than life, though so often it had
seemed as if the waves of care and sorrow would
engulf his tired soul.</p>

<p>Many officers, and others able to secure leave of
absence or passes, hastened to witness this greatest
of our national events. With other State Agency
ladies, I was anxious to break the long strain of
caring for sick and wounded patients amid scenes
of the horrors of war and bloodshed. Nine thousand
men, at different times, filled this well-organized
camp. Mangled bodies were brought directly
in from the battle-fields where they had fallen, by
means of temporary rails, on rough bare sand cars,
on which they were piled like so many logs, one
upon another, so great was the need of haste to get
them to the hospital. All of these were covered
with dirt, powder, blood, torn uniforms, and seemed
an almost indistinguishable mass; while many a
half-severed limb dangled from a shattered human
trunk.</p>

<p>I was fortunate in being able to go to Washington
quite independently, without fear of detention,
having a pass from General Grant that ordered all
guards, pickets, steamboats and government roads
to pass “Miss Ada W. Smith,” and which practically
would have allowed me to travel free without
question over the entire Northern States, as all
roads were then under government control. Thus
was I enabled to accept the invitation of Dr. Hettie
K. Painter, Pennsylvania State Agent, and her husband,
to join their party going to Washington. On
arriving in that city we went to a small hotel, where
we met some Western friends, and found there also
a former patient from City Point, Lieutenant Gosper,
who had lost a leg in the skirmish before Petersburg,
and was now convalescent. He manifested
the usual cheerfulness of wounded men,
while waiting to have an artificial limb adjusted,—&#8203;a
free gift from the government.</p>

<p>We had secured tickets and good places to see
the official ceremony; but the surging mass of humanity
crowded us quite beyond hearing. On this
eventful morning a raw, threatening gale blew dust
and loose debris into our eyes and faces, nearly
blinding us.</p>

<p>“And men looked up with mad disquietude upon
the dull sky,” as we awaited the signal of the
President’s coming. At last the tall, gaunt form
of Mr. Lincoln came forward on to the portico of
the Capitol, surrounded by officials and attendants.
Chief Justice Chase opened the great Bible, and
President Lincoln stepped forward, placing his hand
upon the book to take, for the second time, his oath
of office. At this moment, the leaden sky, that had
not lifted during the day, suddenly opened a small
rift, while a strong bright ray of sunshine shot
through and rested upon the noble head of the
soon-to-be-glorified martyr. A silence of awe
seemed for a moment to overspread the startled
multitude, and then the darkening gloom closed
down again as with an ominous foreboding. But
not a word of that memorable address could we
hear above the soughing, cold, gusty wind.</p>

<p>While planning for the reception, our young lieutenant,
sensitive and refined, positively declined to
accompany us, repeating only: “It is no place for a
cripple.”</p>

<p>After we had exhausted all other arguments, a
happy thought came to me: “Well, Lieutenant, if
you will not go with us I suppose I shall have to
stay away also; each of the other ladies has an
escort, and, as every lady must be attended, I can
not go alone.”</p>

<p>“Would you go to a reception with a cripple on
a crutch?” he replied, sadly.</p>

<p>My answer came quickly and sincerely: “I would
be proud of such an escort!”</p>

<p>At last he consented, rather reluctantly, to accompany
us. At the appointed hour we started for
the evening reception. Soon, however, we found
ourselves in a frightful crush of people, crowding up
the White House steps, and we quickly closed
around the lieutenant, fearing he might get under
foot. Our party was carried up bodily to the landing,
where I found that my arm was quite badly
bruised by the crutch.

<p>After getting breath and composing ourselves, we
fell into the long procession of couples approaching
the President, where the ushers went through the
form of taking our names and introducing us. In
passing we saw a group of cabinet officers and a
number of ladies with Mrs. Lincoln, who was
gowned in white satin with a deep black thread lace
flounce over an expansive skirt, in the style of that
day; and she wore her favorite head dress, a wreath
of natural pink roses entirely around her plainly
dressed hair.</p>

<p>The President’s band played stirring airs in an
adjoining room, while crowds of every grade passed
on, some in dashing uniforms, some in evidently
fresh “store clothes,” others in gorgeous costumes,
and the good women from the country in sensible
black,—&#8203;with ill-fitting gloves. It was a motley
democratic crowd, such as could be seen in no royal
country, and of which we are justly proud. Following
the almost endless procession we saw the
unmistakable form of Mr. Lincoln, his long arm and
white-gloved hand reaching out to shake hands, and
bowing in a mechanical manner, plainly showing
that he wished this demand of the people was well
over.</p>

<p>Suddenly straightening up his tall form, while
continuing the handshaking, he looked eagerly
down the line and, to my surprise, as the lieutenant
and I approached, he stepped out before us and,
grasping the hand of the crippled soldier, he said in
an unforgettable tone of deep sympathy: “God
bless you, my boy! God bless you!” Owing to
the lieutenant’s crutch I was obliged to take his left
arm which brought me on the outside away from
the President. I attempted to pass with a bow, but
he stood in my way, still holding out his large hand,
until I released mine and gave it to him, receiving
a warm, sympathetic grasp. Then I saw that wonderful
lighting of his kindly beneficent grey eyes,
that for a moment often beautified as with a halo
that otherwise plain, sad face. As we moved on,
the lieutenant exclaimed in happy exultation, “Oh!
I’d lose another leg for a man like that!”</p>

<p>Such was the magnetic tone and touch of that
rare spirit that carried hope and trust to the hopeless
sorrowing, the great heart that could with truth
and sincerity enfold not only his own country, but
the whole human brotherhood of the world, and
caused him to reply in effect to those who wished
him to subscribe to some special creed: “When I
can find a church broad enough to take in the whole
human race, then I will join it.”</p>

<p>Once again I saw President Lincoln, after the inaugural,
early in April—&#8203;that fateful month in
which occurred the last battle of the rebellion, the
surrender of heroic Lee, the act of the magnanimous
Grant, the imprisonment of the Confederate
leader, the conference of those great men of war
and state.</p>

<p>When Abraham Lincoln had come, in his own
boat the River Queen, to meet Grant and Sherman
at City Point, he was so secure in the conclusion of
peace at last, that he had brought Mrs. Lincoln and
“little Tad” to share in the general rejoicing.</p>

<p>I did not see Mrs. Lincoln at that time, and I had
also missed seeing her in 1863, when I had taken
to the famous Soldier’s Rest and Hospital in Philadelphia
one soldier blinded by a bullet that passed
through his head, cutting both optic nerves, one
who had lost both legs, and another who had lost
both arms.</p>

<p>During the war, when the troops were en route to
the front and halted in Philadelphia, the great Liberty
Bell announced their coming, and hundreds of
women and many men hastened with bountiful supplies
to this great Rest, where they set up rough
wooden tables. Here many passing regiments had
a generous meal, and almost lifted the roof with
their grateful shouts, exceeded only by those of the
outside crowd as they marched away to the jolly
tune of the fife and drum.</p>

<p>At City Point the three Titans of war and state—&#8203;Lincoln,
Grant and Sherman—&#8203;met with navy
and state officers to conclude the terms of surrender
and peace. There was no desire to confirm the
battle cry, “Hang Jeff Davis,” as in most countries
would have been inevitable, and even sympathy and
mercy inspired the closing acts of this national
tragedy that had cost the lives of thousands of
brave Southerners, and of those of the invincible
North.</p>

<p>During this mighty conclave at City Point, Abraham
Lincoln was occasionally seen riding to the
front and about camp and hospital, and to visit the
tents, in his sombre black suit and high hat towering
above many striking uniforms about him. It
was a singular fact that while many ministers had
come down to “overlook the field” dressed in the
same fashion, except that there was always somehow
a ministerial dip of the front corners of their
long frock coats that at once betrayed their profession,
they were often ridiculed and guyed by the
rough soldiers. Yet the thought of ridicule was
never suggested for this unique man who seemed to
dignify and honor everything he touched, even
when, in the same style, he rode his horse in an ungainly
manner. He could have ridden bareback
without loss of dignity.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions Mr. Lincoln had ridden
up from the Point to visit our hospital, and was, as
usual, accompanied by crowds of devoted friends as
he walked through the divisions and avenues of the
different camps. There were gathered the sick and
wounded of the Ninth, Sixth, Fifth, Second Corps,
and the Corps d’ Afric, who were frequently visited
by their regimental surgeons and officers of regiments
that were encamped before Petersburg.</p>

<p>I shall always regret not speaking to Mr. Lincoln
at that time. It would have been very easy to do,
but I could not see the coming catastrophe, and I
hesitated to push forward into the surrounding
crowd to be presented. As he passed from tent to
tent, with many a cheerful word to the suffering
men, a young man connected with the Sanitary
Commission, now Doctor Jerome Walker, a successful
physician of Brooklyn, said, pointing to
some tents near-by, “Mr. President, you do not
want to go in there!”</p>

<p>“Why not, my boy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, they are sick rebel prisoners.”</p>

<p>With a hasty movement he said, “That is just
where I do want to go,” and he strode within the
tent, shaking hands and speaking such words of
comfort as only his magnanimous spirit could
prompt, to the grateful surprise and pleasure of the
Confederate patients.</p>


<p class="p2 center">ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DEATH OF
PRESIDENT LINCOLN</p>

<p>On the morning of April 15th, 1865, as the sun
rose over our quiet hospital camp, I was startled by
the sound of galloping hoofs, that stopped suddenly
before our tent. Scratching on the canvas indicated
the usual sign for admission. Hastily untying
the tent flaps, I found Major William Baker, of
the Tenth Colored Troops, still mounted, and betraying
much agitation and haste, when he said: “I
have just ridden up to tell you, the first person in
the hospital, the sad news of the reported death of
the President. All officers were assembled at 2
A. M. to a conference, when the reported assassination
by Wilkes Booth was read, but not yet
officially confirmed.” With a sad expression and
a salute he put spurs to his horse and dashed back
to City Point.</p>

<p>Telegrams were slow in those days, so it was not
till the afternoon that the terrible, cruel tragedy
was announced at the hospital camp. The shock
was paralyzing, and a sombre silence spread over
the wards containing the men who had learned to
love this great soul. Men and women as well as
soldiers wept together as for a loved, indulgent
father, who had borne his crushing responsibilities
without a murmur or a cry for help. A few copperhead
patients dared to approve of the murderous
act, but they were soon beaten into silence with the
crutches of the indignant crippled convalescents.</p>

<p>With a vague desire to express in some way their
grief, men came and begged for a bit of black to
fasten over their tents, and if any were so luckless
as to have a black suit they saw it speedily reduced
to shreds and flying from the entrances of the wards
or tents. But other men still begged so earnestly
for some black emblem, that I at last gave to them
a full train black skirt that I could illy spare. This
soon became floating ribbons over many a tent, to
the great satisfaction of the loyal boys, having so
little by which they could express their sorrow. In
a few days some of us were so fortunate as to receive
from home or from Washington, mourning
badges of suitable designs, which we wore as a mark
of respect to our dead President.</p>

<p>In making the rounds among my scattered patients
I stopped to speak to Major Prentiss, of a
New York regiment, who had captured his wayward
young brother—&#8203;a Captain in the Sixth
Maryland Confederate Infantry—&#8203;now lying in
the same ward quite near, having lost a leg. The
Captain, a handsome, cheerful youth, whose happy
jokes and stories kept his neighbours quite diverted
from the tedium of convalescence, was recovering
slowly; but the Major had been shot through the
lung, and one could hear the air passing through the
unhealed wound. He looked so longingly at the
badge I was wearing, that another brother, who
had come South to take the patients home if possible,
said: “He would be so happy if he could have
a badge.” It was impossible to ignore the wish of
a dying soldier, so I took off the one I was wearing
and pinned it over his heart. He could not speak
his thanks, but a rare smile of intense satisfaction
spread over the sufferer’s countenance.</p>

<p>As in most great catastrophes, it seemed for a
time as if the world must stand still; but many patients
still needed care, and we were obliged to go
on with our work till all the sick were sent home or
to Northern hospitals, and each resumed his daily
duty, while the spirit of sadness hovered over the
hospital campus.

<h3>A RECENT LETTER FROM DOCTOR MARY
BLACKMAR BRUSON</h3>


<p class="right r2">
“Jacksonville, Florida,<br>
April, 1910.<br>
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MY DEAR ADA:</p>

<p>At your request I send some incidents of
camp life as they come to mind.</p>

<p>After one of the fearful onslaughts at Petersburg,
the wounded came pouring into my tent, which was
nearest to the firing line, so that a drummer-lad
had named it ‘The Half Way House’. One lad
dropped from the wagon in which he was being
transported, as they passed my tent. I ran and
cried out to the driver. He coolly replied ‘He is
dead, what does it matter!’</p>

<p>I knelt by the boy’s side and found a remote evidence
of life, but hemorrhage was so profuse it
seemed he could not survive. I called the attention
of surgeons, but all said ‘We must go on’. So
with my knowledge that life was not extinct, and
that he was so young and had the force of youth,
(moreover the hardships of the Confederates had
toughened him), I remained on the ground at his
side not daring to leave him, but compelled to use
my fingers as a tampon.</p>

<p>I remained with him twenty-four hours before I
felt safe in having him carried to a ward. Cramped
and exhausted from such a strain, in addition to
weakness induced by loss of sleep through nights
and days previous, I could hardly crawl into my
tent. Being cold I heated a brick, put it in my cot
and was soon so deeply sunk in oblivion, it seemed
I would have remained so forever, but for my companions,
Misses V. and M., who came in at midnight.
Soon after they retired they discovered a
dense smoke filling the tent and were aware of
burning wool. They called me again and again,
but getting no reply they jumped up and pulled me
from the burning cot and finally roused me, so that
I calmly dressed.</p>

<p>Morning found my limbs, from ankles to knees,
one solid blister, but this I was at first too stupid
to realize, or even the danger which I had escaped
through my faithful friends. No one knew of the
accident but ourselves, and I went about my work
as usual. Nature alone was the healer.</p>

<p>One day I asked a poor exhausted soldier—&#8203;so
feeble from disease and exposure that he could only
whisper—&#8203;if there was anything he wished, and
said that if so I would try to get it for him. With
tears and sighs he replied, “O, Miss, if you would
only get me some fried bacon with molasses poured
over it, I would get well!” It was a novel dish to
me but was easily attained, and the man’s appetite
was so quickened by the relishable food that he
began to recover forthwith. In later years I
learned that very many looked upon it as a special
delicacy.

<p>I was finally placed in charge of the Confederate
wards, and there saw that grandest of men, President
Lincoln. This was after the last assault on
Petersburg, and men horribly wounded and sick,
from both armies, were rushed into our camp hospital
at City Point. I was given especial care of
the private Confederates, and my companion, that
fine, grand woman, Miss Vance, took charge of the
Confederate officers. I had only an orderly to assist
me—&#8203;a boy about sixteen,—&#8203;and what with
the cleaning and caring for each sick, torn body,
our powers were strained to the utmost limit of endurance.
Our patients’ cots were so close together
that we could just squeeze between, and our ward
so long that it required from three to four tents.</p>

<p>General Grant was at City Point, and President
Lincoln came down at this time, before our army
marched into Richmond. One day both of them
were coming slowly down my avenue. The orderly
rushed in and cried out—&#8203;‘President Lincoln’s
coming!’ I was at the extreme end of the hospital
tent, but, girl-like, started forward that I might see
him. At that instant, oh, such a puny, helpless
wail, as of sick and dying infants, issued from every
throat: ‘Oh, don’t leave us, Miss! He is a beast!
He will kill us!’</p>

<p>I replied: ‘Oh, no! He is a grand good man!’
Again and again came forth that puny wail, ‘Don’t
leave us, Miss!’ till I finally said, ‘Well, I’ll not
leave you, don’t fear!’ but by that time I had got
to the front of the tent and the orderly had pulled
back a flap on my request so that I peered out.
Within about fifteen or twenty feet were both men.
General Grant with the inevitable cigar, and President
Lincoln, so tall, so lank, giving evidence of
much sorrow, looming over him. I heard General
Grant say distinctly, ‘These are the Confederate
quarters’. President Lincoln immediately said,
‘I wish to go in here alone!’</p>

<p>I drew myself up into the corner as close as possible,
and he bent under the open flap and came in.
He went at once to a bedside, and reverently leaned
over almost double so low were the cots, and
stroked the soldier’s head, and with tears streaming
down his face he said in a sort of sweet anguish,
“Oh, my man, why did you do it?” The boy in
gray said, or rather stammered weakly, almost in a
whisper, ‘I went because my State went’. On
that ground floor, so quiet was the whole ward, a
pin could almost have been heard to fall. President
Lincoln went from one bedside to another and
touched each forehead gently, and with tears
streaming asked again the question, and again
heard the same reply. When he finally passed out
from those boys, some grey and grizzled, but many
of them children, there came as from one voice,
‘Oh, we didn’t know he was such a good man!
We thought he was a beast!’</p>

<p>At the close of hostilities, I, with many others,
went with the army to Richmond and Washington,
and there saw the final parade of 60,000 troops
before the White House. I afterward returned to
my college and hospital and completed my studies,
and since then have led a strenuous life as a practising
physician in Florida.</p>

<p>As ever,</p>

<p class="center">
Your old Comrade,<br>
</p>

<p class="right r2">

<h3>LAST OF CITY POINT</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> some early chapters on the good work of the
Sanitary Commission I wrote of the denuded
hospital camp, belated sick soldiers, etc. After
the departure of the Second Corps hospital officers,
I was the only white woman in camp, and I took
possession of their headquarters, in a rustic cottage
of one story built by the engineer corps in pretty
artistic style with boughs and branches cut from the
woods near by.</p>

<p>Four rooms, with central entrance, made a comfortable
homelike shelter where “Aunty” also
stayed and looked after my interests. The colored
guard detailed by General Russell marched their
steady beat daily and nightly, while a stack of muskets
stood before my little door. A circular lawn
was often occupied by negroes anxious for a word
with “De bressed white Yankee lady,” while their
picanninies, rolling on the grass, made the place
quite lively, despite the warnings of Auntie to
“Dem black niggers dat ain’t got no manners no-how.”</p>

<p>This kind-hearted old mammy always, somehow,
managed to have a bright bandanna turban and a
fresh white apron. She took that rare possession
of me, known only to house servants of southern
families.

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_235.jpg"
 alt="My quarters">
 <p class="caption">MY QUARTERS AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Mrs. Russell remained in her husband’s headquarters
at the Point, and afforded me many pleasant
social courtesies. General Russell invited me for a
buggy ride to Petersburg, still under command of
General Willcox.</p>

<p>As we rode by the deserted earthworks and
former lines in front of Petersburg,—&#8203;the field of
the last battle being still strewn with empty canteens,
broken muskets, etc., its earthworks upturned
and great chasms torn as if by an earthquake,—&#8203;General
Russell pointed to a wrecked
fort saying “That was the Burnside mine, the
‘Crater’ where I lost three hundred of the bravest
soldiers that ever went into battle. They were the
negro hero martyrs of the Burnside mine explosion,
where many a brave Yankee white boy also gave up
his life.”</p>

<p>General Russell’s brigade included a number of
regiments, among them the Tenth Colored Regiment,
with Major William Baker, of Maine, commanding.
At the close of the war it was ordered
to Texas to subdue the turbulent element and to
protect helpless citizens. We met many destitute
negroes still flocking to City Point.</p>

<p>As soon as the front lines were abandoned, hundreds
of negroes ran from Petersburg to beg our
chaplains to marry them. Some were very young;
and a grey-haired old man said, “Me and Belinda
has just stood by each other ever since we was
a’most boy and gall; our chillun is sol’ away, and
we wants to get married like white folks, so we
can’t be separated no mo’.” This seemed the ultimatum
of their understanding of freedom.

<p>Conversions and immersions filled most of their
time. These ragged homeless freedmen were gaining
some glimmering of morality and religion; but
it was a motley crowd that assembled on the shore
of the James River, shouting and singing in their
childish way, as they were immersed one by one, by
their own preacher or leader,—&#8203;then rising and
shouting hallelujahs as they sprang up and down in
the water in a frenzied manner, quite ludicrous to
observe.</p>

<p>Contrabands were spying out the desolate land,
and looking for jobs. Surgeon Thomas Pooley
was put in charge of this denuded hospital, and
joined my mess in the little cottage where Auntie
made some palatable southern dishes with our remaining
supplies.</p>

<p>The Christian Commission and State Agencies
had “struck their tents” and vanished almost in a
night. Happily the Sanitary Commission, with
their larger work and supplies, had been detained
until the arrival of the stranded regiment, (of which
I wrote earlier) when with a detail from General
Russell’s brigade, still in command of the deserted
United States quarters at the Point, they were enabled
to reconstruct a sheltered ward into a degree
of comfort for the exhausted men. Lack of discipline
and policing soon resulted in disorder and untidiness
in these formerly perfectly systematized
camps. Quantities of unportable home-made furniture,
etc., and general debris were left, to the delight
of the destitute contrabands. All government
tents and property had been “turned in” and
strictly registered.</p>

<p>I well remember my farewell glance at the demolished
hospital, as I rode for the last time to City
Point to take the transport for Washington. Tent
roofs gone, only stockade sides remained intact;
bunks stripped and bare, much was abandoned that
would now be useless to the army. Negroes
swarmed like bees around these treasures, and some
improvised roofs and shelter from abundant material
lying about, and seemed happy in this temporary
home with little thought of the future, or
knowledge of the Freedmen Bureau then under
General Howard’s management, devising means to
save them from starvation.</p>

<p>I took leave of my faithful, tearful old Auntie,
evidently a leader among the irresponsible bewildered
contrabands, who felt perfectly happy and safe
as long as the Yankees were there to protect them.</p>

<p>At City Point, where little remained to show the
old site of General Grant’s Headquarters of the
United States Armies, as I went aboard a government
transport bound for New York, I showed for
the last time my pass, that had given me protection
and much independence, and as I look back I am
surprised as I think of my perfect freedom from
restraint in choosing my patients and my work in
the hospital and State Agencies.</p>

<p>As the shore receded, leaving a broken outline of
the hospital and Point, a feeling of homesickness,
followed by thoughts of trials, discomforts, pleasures,
and hopes in our active life among the sick
and dying,—&#8203;as well as the thought of the many
recovered and sent home to their friends by army
women,—&#8203;all these passed in kaleidoscopic
changes, as, almost alone on board the transport, I
turned my face toward Washington, and the months
of hospital work waiting for me there. The very
last object that attracted my attention, as I looked
back, was on a hill just outside the hospital grounds.
A great leather army shoe that, on the horizon,
looked about the size of a small row boat or canoe,
stood out in bold relief. This set me laughing as I
remembered the night attempt of the owner to steal
from our little house, and the fact that in his flight,
months before, he had lost his shoe, not daring to
return for it lest he be captured and punished. This
monument of his failure remained.

<h3>WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK STATE
AGENCY</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Arrived</span> in Washington I went directly to
the home of my army friend, Doctor Hettie
K. Painter, to remain until I decided upon
my next move. The following day I reported to
Colonel Goodrich, head of New York State Agency
in Washington, and found that he wished me to remain
and assist him in the closing up of the Washington
work. This meant the visiting of the several
hospitals scattered at long distances over the
city and suburbs. Army Square, Douglas and
Harewood Hospitals sheltered most of the New
York men. I listened to their many complaints at
being so long detained when they seemed quite able
to travel, but were delayed for various reasons.
The work was chiefly of a clerical form, viz.: to
find out what difficulties detained the men, and why,
when they were entitled to a discharge, it could not
be obtained. Some could not get their pay, some
had lost their descriptive lists, a few were waiting
for their friends to take them home, while still
other disabilities interfered.</p>

<p>Owing to the great distances between hospitals
which involved a great deal of walking, considerable
time was lost and much fatigue followed. I therefore
determined to go to Medical Headquarters and
ask for an ambulance on the strength of the pass
that I still held from General Grant. This authority,
of course, was good only during the war, but
after some explanations the medical authorities
courteously offered to give me the use of a medical
headquarters ambulance, though all ambulances had
been “called in.”</p>

<p>The next morning one came for me, and I was
driven to the New York Agency, greatly to the surprise
of Colonel Goodrich, who gave me a list of
hospital soldiers to visit. At the close of the day I
was able to make a complete report. The time
saved in driving was considerable, and I was able to
accomplish much more than those who had to walk
long distances from hospital to hospital, as other
agents had then to do.</p>

<p>The following day, on calling at the agency for
my list, the Colonel said: “Miss Smith, you may
visit the near by hospitals to-day, and I will use the
ambulance for other work.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, Colonel,” I replied, “I am responsible
for the ambulance and no one can use it
except by my invitation. If any agent would like
to be dropped at any hospital I shall be very happy
to accommodate him.”</p>

<p>The New York Agency ambulance had been
called in, which was rather irritating. The Colonel
never quite forgave me this independence, and some
time later he remarked, regarding the failure to put
through a troublesome case: “Perhaps Miss Smith,
with her usual pertinacity, might accomplish it.”

<p>“If you can not succeed, Colonel, it is no reason
why I should not,” I replied quickly. “Please give
me the case.”</p>

<p>Putting my whole interest and energy into the
work, I soon had the satisfaction of reporting the
case as settled satisfactorily.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_242.jpg"
 alt="BOSTON CORBETT">
 <p class="caption">SERGEANT BOSTON CORBETT</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>During a visit to Harewood Hospital, I observed
a very sleek-looking young man, apparently absorbed
in reading the Bible. This man I found was
the notorious Boston Corbett who had disobeyed
orders to capture Booth alive. He had shot him in
the barn, then burning, and which was surrounded
by a cordon of troops. For this disobedience Corbett
had been imprisoned, but ill-health had brought
him to the hospital. I asked him why he had disobeyed
orders, and he replied that Booth was about
to get away, and he thought it better to shoot him
than to run the chance of having him escape. I
then asked how he came to have such a remarkable
name. He replied: “When I was born my father
could not decide upon a name for me, so being a
very religious man, he asked the Lord, and the
Lord said ‘Call him Boston’.” I still have the
photograph he gave me in his favorite Bible-reading
pose.</p>

<p>The piazza of Mrs. Painter’s house was separated
from that of the adjoining house only by a railing.
Here lived a Southern family consisting of father,
mother and a beautiful daughter. The father had
been secretary to Jefferson Davis, and from a social
point of view, was an elegant courteous gentleman.
I greatly enjoyed his Southern accent and refined
conversation. He had been obliged, through poverty,
to rent a part of his house to some Northern
politicians.</p>

<p>One day I saw going up the steps, a fine-looking
man, Colonel Forney, a prominent politician of that
day. He asked politely of this Southern gentleman,
then seated on the piazza, if he could see Mr. B.,
whereupon the owner of the house flew into a rage,
as if insulted, and said: “I don’t know, suh, ring the
bell for the servant!” As the servant opened the
door for the Colonel to pass, the irate gentleman
said to him, quite childishly,—&#8203;but in fierce tones,—&#8203;“Bring
me my cut glass carafe of cold water instantly.”</p>

<p>A few days later, as we were again sitting on the
piazza, having a pleasant chat, this same gentleman
told me, with great indignation, of the insults they
were now compelled to take from free niggers. He
said that a servant maid had become so independent
that she would not answer her mistress’ bell. “I
determined to stop such presumption and ordered
my wife to continue ringing while I went down and
hid myself behind the kitchen door. The bell rang
and rang again while the wench laughed and said
to another servant: ‘She can just keep on a ringin’,
an’ when I gets good and ready I’ll come!’ This
was too much,” he said. “I went quickly forward
into the kitchen and slapped her black face twice!
The insolent hussy had the temerity to have me
hauled to court and bound over to keep the peace!”
This was the saddest effect I had yet seen of the
influence of slave-holding.</p>

<p>While boarding with Mrs. Painter I met that
eccentric yet anomalous woman, Doctor Mary
Walker, pleasant, refined and interesting, despite
the semi-masculine garb she had then adopted.
Her husband, an army surgeon, was, I think, then
living, but died soon after the war.</p>

<p>In speaking of her dress, her arguments and logic
were unanswerable. She wore loose, long trousers
to boot tops, a skirt below her knees, a close-fitting
jacket and cape, much like an officer’s, high collar
and soft hat, all rather becoming for her petite style.</p>

<p>“You,” she said, “with long skirts, sweep up
and carry home with you samples of all sorts of
filth from the streets, and besides you are not
modest, for when you must lift your skirts there is
always a suggestive display of hosiery, while I go
home free from extraneous matter and never have
to expose my ankles.” This was perfect hygiene
and logical; and many times in my army work I
wished I could go about without drabbled skirts.</p>

<p>Doctor Walker was, I think, a graduate physician
and did much good among sick soldiers. But
she gradually grew more pronounced in her mannish
attire, and was many times arrested for that infringement
of the law. She always pleaded her
own case so logically that she was generally dismissed
with a reprimand, and cautioned not to do so
again. But to this warning she paid no regard;
and at one time entered the court-room bearing the
United States flag and claiming her rights as an
American citizen.</p>

<p>The last I heard of Doctor Mary Walker was
from a friend who, in 1908, saw her,—&#8203;then grown
old,—&#8203;in a Brooklyn car. She was dressed in full
male costume,—&#8203;trousers, collar, tie, dress coat,
high silk hat, and held a gaudy little cane.</p>

<p>It was reported that, at a recent Suffrage Convention
in Albany, Doctor Walker claimed that
New Jersey’s early constitution included Women’s
Suffrage,—&#8203;that this part of the constitution was
never finally repealed, though abrogated in some
way, and that therefore New Jersey is a Suffrage
State.

<h3>OLD CAPITOL PRISON, WASHINGTON D. C.,
1865</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the unusual cases that often fell to
me, was that of an elderly man, who had at
one time been a judge in New Jersey, but
drink had been his undoing. He was now serving
a Civil Service sentence for petty larceny in Old
Capitol Prison. I saw at once that he was a “bummer,”
but that he had been a gentleman while
sober. I did not feel much interest in this man
personally, but he showed me a letter from his son,
evidently educated, in which he begged his father
to come home, saying he would take care of him
and they might live together and be happy. The
man had been a soldier for a short time, but had
been degraded and discharged, and was now a
prisoner of Civil Law. It was a difficult case, but
for the sake of his faithful son I undertook it. I
went to Judge Carter, of that district, urging him to
let the man go.</p>

<p>“It is of no use, Miss Smith. The old fellow is a
scamp and not to be trusted for a moment,” was
the reply. “He will steal anything, and if I should
let him go to-day he would be back here to-morrow
on another charge. He was arrested on the charge
of stealing a wheel-barrow.”</p>

<p>“Why, Judge,” I said, laughing, “he did not
know what he was doing. He might as well have
stolen a grindstone!”</p>

<p>This seemed greatly to amuse the judge, and he
said directly: “Well, that settles it; if you will see
that he goes out of the city on the train to his son,
he may go. If he gets free he will be back here in
a week on another charge.”</p>

<p>Quite pleased with my success, I went to the
Sanitary Commission, still in Washington, secured
a ticket to his home, and wrote to his son to meet
him; then I notified the old man to be ready at a
certain hour the next day when I would call for him.</p>

<p>When I went to the prison for him he began a
round of deliberate lying, and tried every subterfuge
to evade me and get away, so that he might remain
in Washington. Finally I said: “You will go with
me to the train where I will put you in charge of the
conductor, who will deliver you to your son, and if
you will not agree to this you may remain where
you are.”</p>

<p>At last we started on our way down Pennsylvania
Avenue. He insisted that the Government owed
him money, so I took him to General Brice’s office,
where his clerks soon found a record of desertion,
fraud, and bounty-jumping. I lost no time in getting
him to the train, threatening to have him arrested
if he attempted to give me the slip. The
conductor took him in charge and promised to deliver
him to his son, and I was glad to get the old
sinner off my hands. A few days after, I received
a grateful letter from the faithful son.

<p>Some months later I chanced to see a Jersey
paper which stated that my old scamp had been arrested
for stealing photograph albums, and that he
had formerly been a reputable judge.</p>

<p>On returning from the train I stopped at the War
Department for advice in some other cases. There
I chanced to meet General Winfield Hancock, who
gave me his autograph, and, chatting easily, we
walked up Pennsylvania Avenue. And so it happened
that I had walked down Pennsylvania Avenue
with a miserable old “prison bird” and had walked
up the Avenue with “the handsomest man in the
army,” whose appearance was greatly enhanced
by a spotless, brilliant uniform.</p>

<p>At Army Square Hospital I met again my
former patient of City Point, who had captured
his young rebel brother, the Captain. Their
faithful brother had, with much care and difficulty,
succeeded in bringing them to this hospital, but
the cheerful young captain had died there from
gangrene,—&#8203;perhaps due to carelessness. The
Major, weaker than when at City Point, unable to
speak, motioned his brother to say that he had not
forgotten the Lincoln badge I had given him, and
that he would always cherish it. His devoted
brother had struggled heroically to reach their
city, and the Major had at least his wish to die at
home. Thus ended another of the many tragedies
of our unholy, unnecessary war.</p>

<p>During my last weeks in Washington, I attended
a session of the trial of Wirz, a Swiss, formerly
turnkey of Andersonville prison, who was later
found guilty of barbarous treatment of prisoners of
war and condemned to be hanged, with eight conspirators
against the life of President Lincoln, including
Mrs. Surette. I believe, however, that
only four, including Mrs. Surette, were executed.
These were the only traitors that suffered ignominious
death. Can any other victorious nation
show such Christian clemency?</p>

<p>Assisted by the Agency and Government Departments,
I had great success in difficult cases.
After much travelling about from one department
to another in the interest of a convalescent soldier,
I collected for him fifty dollars,—&#8203;which was long
due, and which at once enabled him to start for his
home, greatly elated by his freedom.</p>

<p>An erratic, wild Irishman was made almost delirious
by getting his long delayed three hundred
dollars, and insisted upon giving me fifty dollars
of it, but I informed him that I did not work for
pay. He wrote me from New York later, on a
double sheet of cap, in letters an inch long, with
“God bless you!” scrawled all over the page.</p>

<p>Having left Doctor Painter’s hospitable home, I
was now boarding on K Street, where I met a
most charming blonde Scotch girl—&#8203;Cordelia
Anderson, holding a responsible position in the
Treasury Department. She made my evenings delightful,
as had my friend Annie Bain in our field
tent at City Point, after the strain, the work and
indignation of almost every day. A few years
later, this rare young woman, still in Washington
in July of ’67, sent for me to come to her on my
way north on my vacation from Norfolk, Virginia,
where I was Superintendent of Colored Schools.
She was very ill with typhoid. I nursed her till
the doctor insisted that for my own health I must
leave her, when a kindly old Auntie took charge
until her recovery.</p>

<p>The intolerable heat of Washington at that season
was unusual. The streets were not paved, and
a fine impalpable dust, continually rising, was
suffocating. At the boarding house where we
were, I saw the most astonishing rats, as large as
small cats; and at night when I went down-stairs
to get ice for the sick girl, they ran up-stairs ahead
of me, and coolly sat upon their haunches, blinking
at me with their vicious black eyes.

<h3>THE LAST ACT IN MY DRAMA AT
WASHINGTON</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">While</span> still working at high tension I suddenly
became aware that even my great
vitality and good health demanded a rest,
and I was preparing to leave for home, when Mr.
Huron, of the Indiana State Agency, who had
nearly lost his pretty wife by typhoid at City
Point, came urging me to undertake an unusually
difficult case, an application for discharge. I insisted
that I had not enough energy left to win another
case. His discharge had been repeatedly
blocked, even though urged by the Secretary of
the State of Indiana, and there seemed to be no
hope of sending this brave soldier home. However,
Mr. Huron’s statement of injustice was so
exasperating that, in righteous indignation, I determined
to remain and make one more effort at
this last moment. This man, who had served his
full term of four years honorably, and had lost a
leg, was, without consent, placed on the roll of the
Invalid Corps, which indignity old soldiers considered
a stain on their army escutcheon. Many
appeals had failed to accomplish his discharge.
The case was always “referred back” to the hospital
where it was duly “pigeon-holed.” The
man’s sister had come to Washington expecting to
take him home to Indiana, but for weeks all their
efforts had failed, and now some legal complications
had culminated which required his presence
at home to save their little property and farm.</p>

<p>The next day I went to the hospital, and after
listening to the man’s statement I went directly to
the surgeon in charge, and stated the case,—&#8203;to
which he replied with some discourtesy. Having
received the utmost courtesy and respect and attention
from all the departments when I had asked
for help, my temper rose to the occasion when he
said: “The man has no descriptive list, and I will
attend to it when I think best!”</p>

<p>“That will not answer my purpose,” I replied
warmly. “I wish the man to go at once!” and I
made some strong statements of the urgency of
the situation. He assumed a dignified silence; on
which I stated emphatically “The man is going!
If you do not help me in the matter, he will go
just the same!” My indignation was then sufficient
to put through a half dozen cases.</p>

<p>Going directly to the Medical Department, I
made known to Surgeons Middletown and Abbott
the unjust detention of this loyal soldier. They
had always promptly aided me in other cases; and
upon hearing my statement they also became indignant,
and offered me every help. I had “turned
in” my ambulance with many thanks, when I intended
to leave for home; but Doctor Middletown
said “You had better have our headquarters’ ambulance,
for you have many miles to travel over
the city to put this matter through, and I will go
‘over the head’ of this surgeon and order him to
order a descriptive list.”</p>

<p>With this document I was much encouraged,
and went next morning to the hospital and my aristocratic
surgeon, who tried not to appear surprised
as he said loftily: “I will attend to it.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” I said, “I came directly from
Headquarters to get your signature, and to deliver
the paper to the Medical Department myself.”</p>

<p>He dared not refuse this order, and sent for the
steward and gave him the paper to fill out the
order. I followed closely on the heels of this man
to his office, where he coolly thrust the paper into
a pigeon-hole and sat down. Surmising that his
intention was to make me wait until after office
hours, I at last said to him: “Steward, if you do
not intend to make out that paper at once I shall
report you to Medical Headquarters.” He soon
found time and made out the paper, and I rode
away to unravel more red tape. At the Medical
Department the doctors signed the paper, and directed
me to take it to the War Department.
Distances were great and office hours short, and
so another day passed. But at the earliest
moment on the following day, we drove to the War
Department, where I found Captain Sam Breck,
now a retired General, a handsome thoroughbred
gentleman who had done me many army favors.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Smith,” he exclaimed cheerfully,
“are you here yet? I thought you were through
with us.”</p>

<p>“Well, Captain, you haven’t got rid of me yet,
and though I am completely tired out, I have taken
another most distressing case, and I’m going to sit
right down here and talk until you help me out.”</p>

<p>Jokingly, he said, “Oh, I can’t stand that, so let
us see if I can save your breath.”</p>

<p>I stated the case as briefly as possible, and his
sense of justice was aroused as he said emphatically,
“I will help you with this case.”</p>

<p>“How long does it take to put through a descriptive
list?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “about three weeks usually!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I exclaimed, “that won’t do. I can’t
stay so long, and if I leave the papers they’ll be
pigeon-holed again.”</p>

<p>He thought a moment, and said, “Let me have
the papers,” and he left me waiting in his office.</p>

<p>On returning the paper he said, “There, Miss
Smith, that has never before been done in this Department.
The descriptive list has been put
through in fifteen minutes. Take it to your
doctor, and he will be obliged to sign it; and then
your man will be free.”</p>

<p>Too delighted and relieved to properly express
my thanks, I said—&#8203;“Good-bye for good this
time, Captain. I promise not to trouble you any
more!”</p>

<p>Again in the ambulance I said to the driver, who
was very much interested, “Now, Orderly, your
horses can not go too fast for me!” and soon we
dashed up to the hospital grounds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the case had become hospital gossip,
and every “Boy” knew of my work. The doctor
gave me the slip, but I followed him up through
the wards till I found him at last in his office. In
passing through the wards I waved the paper saying—&#8203;“Boys,
I have it, I have it!” A low cheer
passed round as the good news spread from ward
to ward.</p>

<p>On presenting this order I said, “Doctor, will
you please sign this?”</p>

<p>With an effort he controlled his expression, and
said quite blandly, “Er, er—&#8203;when would you like to
have this man go?”</p>

<p>“Immediately, if you please!”—&#8203;with extreme
politeness.</p>

<p>“Oh! then I will order the ambulance.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I replied, “I have the Medical
Headquarters’ Ambulance waiting and will take the
man with me just as soon as he can be made
ready.” I then bowed myself out politely.</p>

<p>In half an hour the happy cripple was placed beside
me in the ambulance, and we drove directly
to Mr. Huron’s home, where the now rejoicing
sister was waiting. She started at once to take her
brother home by easy stages, and we heard that
they had reached their little farm in safety. A
letter of appreciation from the Secretary of the
State of Indiana was a satisfactory ending to this
almost impossible case.</p>

<p>In my many visits to this hospital I had discovered
some “irregularities,” for instance, that a
number of soldiers were detained on various pretexts
in order that the requisite number might be
maintained, with their “rations” (thirty-seven
cents per diem) to keep open this hospital. So
many men begged me, almost upon their knees, to
help them. As this was quite beyond my strength
I resolved to report the matter to General Grant’s
headquarters. During my call he listened politely
and silently, laid away his cigar, gave me his attention,
and referred me to Adjutant Bowers, who
exclaimed: “Why, that is impossible! Here is an
order sent some weeks ago directing all convalescents
to be discharged at once!”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, Colonel,” I replied, “the men
remain.”</p>

<p>With some excitement he replied, “If you can
get me the names of these men, and I find that
orders have not been followed, I will close that
hospital, at once.”</p>

<p>This decision and the fact that General Grant
had given me his autograph during my visit, made
me very happy. I diplomatically secured a list of
about twenty men who were being wrongfully detained,
and this was at once conveyed to Colonel
Bowers. This was my “Coup d’ état” in Washington;
and I thought it a good time to retire from
hospital work and to return to my home for rest.
Two weeks later I saw by a Washington paper
that all patients at this hospital able to travel had
been sent home, and a small remainder of those
still sick had been carried to Harewood Hospital,
the former hospital having ended its career.</p>

<p>I had hoped to meet General Grant’s Military
Secretary, General Eli Parker, who wrote the
draft of the surrender of Appomattox. He was
said to have been of imposing appearance. He
was chief of the Senecas and of the Six Nations,
and his Indian name was Donehogawa. When at
home on their reservation with their father, his
sisters, who, when in Washington, were among the
cultured society of the Capitol, wore the rich costumes
of princesses of the tribe and were treated
with the homage due to their rank.</p>

<p>Thus ended my work in Washington for the
“Boys in Blue.”

<h3>TRANSPORTATION HOME</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> war was over, and government passes
and government roads were of the past,
only regular army transportation was now
allowed, except to the Medical Department for the
purpose of sending home delayed patients. My
“Grant Pass,” that had made me so independent,
became at once only a relic. Therefore, being entitled
to transportation to my home, I went to
Surgeon General Barnes, U. S. A., to receive that
privilege. After a pleasant conversation with the
General, he remarked, “Your name is not on the
pay roll, and you are entitled to pay for army
service. If you will make out your claim I will
endorse it.”</p>

<p>To this I replied,—&#8203;with more sentiment, as I
now see it, than judgment,—&#8203;“General, I thank
you, but I do not wish pay for my services in hospital
work. If I had been a man I would have enlisted
as a soldier. But being only a woman it
was all I could do, and I wish to give that service
to my country.”</p>

<p>Often, since then, I have thought of the quizzical
expression of the General’s eyes, though he said
not a word about an impractical girl who did not
think far enough to see what good she might have
done with that accumulated wage of several years.

<p>At that time, however, I was receiving (during
several months) sixty dollars per month as New
York State Agent,—&#8203;the only pay I ever received.
But that seemed different. The war was over.</p>

<p>The General then asked how far I wanted transportation.
I replied that I lived in Brooklyn, but
would take transportation as far as he would give
it. But as I used it only to my home I still have
the following form of transportation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">Resting only a few days after my return to my
home, I was urged by friends on the Sanitary Commission
to assist, with another, a lady of remarkable
ability, a Miss Baldwin, in dispensing some
surplus funds for the Sanitary Commission, with
Headquarters in New York City. This surplus
could not, according to their organization, be used
for other purposes than for the benefit of soldiers.
After much discussion it seemed that the soldiers’
families should be the natural recipients. So
during most of that unusually severe winter,
1865-6, I went daily from my home in Brooklyn
to New York, and with my companion found many
families in need of help, who might otherwise have
perished with cold. When spring brought relief,
the last dollar of that grand life-saving organization
was expended.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>This was, of course, before the day of pensions.
We continued this work until the funds were exhausted.
Then I retired finally from the engrossing
activity of hospital life and caring for soldiers’
families, in which I was engaged from 1862
through 1866.</p>

<p>I had been very happy in this ministration that
daily brought its reward in the gratitude and appreciation
of my “Boys in Blue,” and in the
thought that I had done at least what I could in
that fearful struggle to save our Union and
glorious country.</p>

<p>No one really desires to grow old, but I would
not have missed that call for every heart and hand
to respond to its duty, even to be young again.</p>
